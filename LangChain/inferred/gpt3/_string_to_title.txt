- `param_1`: Renamed to `string_ptr` because based on the context, it seems to be a pointer to a string object.
- `bVar1`: Renamed to `is_first_alpha` because it is used to track if the current character is the first alphabet character encountered.
- `iVar2`: Renamed to `char_val` because it is used to store the ASCII value of a character.
- `local_20`: Renamed to `index` because it is used as an index in a loop.
