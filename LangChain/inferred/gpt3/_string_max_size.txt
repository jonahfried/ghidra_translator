{
  param_1 : num_elements,  // The parameter represents the size of a string
  local_10 : max_size,  // The variable holds the maximum size of a string
}
Reasoning:
- `param_1` is used to represent the number of elements in a string, so `num_elements` is a descriptive name for it.
- `local_10` is used to store the maximum size of a string. Since the function is determining the maximum size, `max_size` is a suitable and concise name to represent this variable.
