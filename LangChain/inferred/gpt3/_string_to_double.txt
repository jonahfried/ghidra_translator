{
  param_1: string_array,
  uVar1: string_length,
  local_10: converted_double,
}
Reasoning:
- `param_1`: The parameter `param_1` is a pointer to a string array, so `param_1` can be named as `string_array`.
- `uVar1`: This variable is used to store the result of the function `_string_empty`, which seems to check if the string is empty. Naming it `string_length` because it likely represents the length of the string.
- `local_10`: This variable is used to store the converted double value. Naming it `converted_double` to indicate that it holds the result of converting a string to a double.
