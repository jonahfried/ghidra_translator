{
  param_1 : string_1_address,
  param_2 : string_2_address,
  iVar1 : comparison_result,
}
Reasoning:
- `param_1`: The first parameter seems to be an address pointing to a string, so `string_1_address` is a descriptive name.
- `param_2`: Similarly, the second parameter is also an address pointing to a string, so `string_2_address` is a suitable name.
- `iVar1`: This variable stores the result of a comparison operation, so `comparison_result` is a concise and descriptive name.
