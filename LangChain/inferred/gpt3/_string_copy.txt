- `param_1` is a pointer to an array which likely represents a string to be copied.
- `param_2` is a pointer to a buffer where the string will be copied.
- `param_3` represents the starting index in the source array from where the copying should begin.
- `param_4` indicates the maximum length of characters to copy.
- `local_38` holds the actual length of characters to be copied.
- `local_10` stores the result of the copying operation.

The chosen names are more descriptive and provide clear meaning based on the context of the code.
