- `param_1`: Renamed to `string_obj_ptr` because it seems to be a pointer to a string object.
- `param_2`: Renamed to `target_str` because it is the string that we are searching for in the object.
- `param_3`: Renamed to `str_len` as it represents the length of the string object.

- `iVar1`: Renamed to `comparison_result` because it holds the result of a comparison operation.
- `sVar2`: Renamed to `target_str_len` as it represents the length of the target string.
- `local_38`: Renamed to `current_pos` as it keeps track of the current position in the string object.
- `local_c`: Renamed to `result` as it holds the final result of the function.
