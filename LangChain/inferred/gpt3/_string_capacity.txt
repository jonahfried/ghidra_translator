{
  param_1: string_ptr,
  local_10: capacity,
}
Reasoning:
- `param_1` is a pointer to a string object, so `string_ptr` is a descriptive name to indicate that it holds the address of a string.
- `local_10` seems to be storing the capacity of the string object, so `capacity` is a clear and concise name to represent this value.
