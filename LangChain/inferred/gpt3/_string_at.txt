}
- `param_1`: Renamed to `string_object_ptr` as it seems to be a pointer to a string object.
- `param_2`: Renamed to `index` since it is used as an index value.
- `local_9`: Renamed to `result_char` as it holds the resulting character value to be returned.

The function `string_at` takes a pointer to a string object (`string_object_ptr`) and an index (`index`) as arguments, and returns the character at the specified index as a result character (`result_char`).
