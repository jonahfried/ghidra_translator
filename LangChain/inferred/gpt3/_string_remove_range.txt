{
  param_1: string_buffer,
  param_2: start_index,
  param_3: end_index,
}
- `string_buffer`: The parameter `param_1` seems to be a pointer to a string buffer, so it can be named `string_buffer`.
- `start_index`: `param_2` is used to represent the starting index of the range to be removed, so `start_index` is a suitable name for it.
- `end_index`: `param_3` is used to represent the ending index of the range to be removed, so `end_index` is a fitting name for it.
