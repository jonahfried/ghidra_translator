- `param_1` is a pointer to the input string.
- `uVar1` is a variable used to store the result of `_string_empty` function, so `is_empty` is a suitable name.
- `lVar2` is a variable used to store the converted value from hex to decimal, so `converted_value` is a descriptive name.
- `local_2b` represents the first character of a hex pair in the input string.
- `local_2a` represents the second character of a hex pair in the input string.
- `local_29` is an unused byte, likely for alignment or padding.
- `local_28` is an index variable for the loop.
- `local_20` is used to store the resulting hex string.
- `local_18` is a pointer to the input string.
- `local_10` is the final result returned by the function.
