{
  param_1 : string_ptr,
  local_10 : result,
}
- `string_ptr` for `param_1`: The parameter `param_1` is a pointer to a string. Naming it `string_ptr` makes it clear that it points to a string.
- `result` for `local_10`: The variable `local_10` stores the result of the function. Naming it `result` indicates its purpose in the function.
  
By using these names, the code becomes more readable and descriptive, aiding in understanding the function's functionality without needing to dive into the implementation details.
