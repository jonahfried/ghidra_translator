Reasoning:
- `param_1`: Renamed to `input_str` since it represents the input string where replacements are made.
- `param_2`: Renamed to `old_str` as it represents the string to be replaced.
- `param_3`: Renamed to `new_str` as it represents the new string to replace `old_str`.
- `pcVar1`: Renamed to `old_str_ptr` as it points to the location of `old_str` in `input_str`.
- `sVar2`: Renamed to `old_str_len` as it stores the length of `old_str`.
- `sVar3`: Renamed to `new_str_len` as it stores the length of `new_str`.
- `sVar4`: Renamed to `remaining_str_len` as it calculates the length of the remaining string after `old_str`.
- `pcVar5`: Renamed to `new_str_ptr` as it points to the location where `new_str` will be inserted.
- `pcVar6`: Renamed to `new_allocated_str` as it represents the newly allocated memory for the modified `input_str`.
