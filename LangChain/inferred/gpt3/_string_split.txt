}
Reasoning:
- `param_1` is the input string that is being split.
- `param_2` is the delimiter used to split the input string.
- `param_3` is used to store the count of splits.
- `pc_var1` is a pointer to a duplicated string for tokenization.
- `u_var2` represents a created string during the process.
- `local_58` is an index variable for the first loop.
- `local_50` is an index variable for the second loop.
- `local_40` represents the current token being processed.
- `local_30` stores the calculated count of splits.
- `local_10` is the array that holds the split strings.
