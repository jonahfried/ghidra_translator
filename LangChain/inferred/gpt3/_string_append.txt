- `param_1` is a pointer to a string buffer, so `string_buffer` is a more descriptive name.
- `param_2` represents the string that needs to be appended, so `str_to_append` is a concise name.
- `sVar1` holds the length of the string to be appended, hence `appended_str_length`.
- `lVar2` denotes the new size of the buffer after appending, hence `new_buffer_size`.
- `lVar3` holds the address of the new buffer after appending, so `new_buffer_address` is a fitting name.
