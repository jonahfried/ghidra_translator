{
  param_1: input_pointer,
  local_30: index_counter,
  local_28: bit_shift_counter,
  local_24: temp_value,
  local_10: encoded_string,
}
Reasoning:
- `param_1`: It is a pointer to the input data, likely a string or byte array.
- `local_30`: It is used as a counter for iterating over the input data.
- `local_28`: It is used as a counter for tracking the number of bits shifted.
- `local_24`: It is a temporary variable to store calculated values during encoding.
- `local_10`: It stores the encoded string that will be returned.
