- `param_1` is a pointer to a string object, so `string_ptr` is a descriptive name.
- `param_2` represents a substring, hence `substring` is a fitting name.
- `sVar1` is used to store the length of the substring, hence `substring_length`.
- `sVar2` is used to store the remaining length after removing the substring, hence `remaining_length`.
- `local_28` seems to be used as a temporary variable to hold the current position, so `current_position` is an appropriate name.
