  local_c : result_index,
}
Explanation:
- `param_1`: Renamed to `string_data_ptr` to indicate that it likely holds a pointer to some string data.
- `param_2`: Renamed to `search_text` to indicate that it is the text being searched for within the string data.
- `param_3`: Renamed to `start_index` to indicate that it represents the starting index for the search.
- `pcVar1`: Renamed to `found_position` to indicate that it stores the position where the search_text was found.
- `local_c`: Renamed to `result_index` to indicate that it is the index of the found position or -1 in case of errors or not found.
