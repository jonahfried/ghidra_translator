{
  param_1 : input_ptr,
  local_10 : result,
}
Reasoning:
- `param_1`: The input parameter is a pointer, likely pointing to an array or a string. Renaming it to `input_ptr` makes its purpose clearer.
- `local_10`: This variable is assigned the result of the addition operation. Renaming it to `result` describes its purpose well.
