{
  param_1 : input_array,
  local_20 : index,
  local_9 : is_alpha,
}
Reasoning:
- `param_1`: The input parameter is a pointer to a long array, likely representing a string. It is better named as `input_array` to indicate its purpose.
- `local_20`: This variable is used as an index for iterating through the input array. Naming it `index` clearly conveys its role.
- `local_9`: This variable is used to store a flag indicating whether the characters in the array are alphabetic. Naming it `is_alpha` makes its purpose clear.
