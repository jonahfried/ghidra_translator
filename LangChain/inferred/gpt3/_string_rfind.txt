- `param_1`: Renamed to `string_obj_ptr` because it seems to be a pointer to a string object.
- `param_2`: Renamed to `search_buffer` as it is used to store the buffer being searched for.
- `param_3`: Renamed to `position` as it represents a position in the search process.
- `iVar1`: Renamed to `comparison_result` as it holds the result of a comparison operation.
- `sVar2`: Renamed to `buffer_length` to represent the length of the buffer being searched.
- `local_40`: Renamed to `end_position` as it seems to represent the end position for searching.
- `local_34`: Renamed to `current_position` as it represents the current position in the search loop.
