{
  param_1 : string1_address,
  param_2 : string2_address,
  iVar1 : comparison_result,
}
Reasoning:
- `param_1`: It seems to be the address of the first string being compared.
- `param_2`: It seems to be the address of the second string being compared.
- `iVar1`: It holds the result of the comparison operation.
- `comparison_result`: Describes the type of the variable `iVar1`, indicating that it holds the result of the comparison operation.
