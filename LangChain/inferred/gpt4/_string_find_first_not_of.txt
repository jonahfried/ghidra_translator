Here's a detailed mapping of placeholder variable names to more descriptive names along with explanations for each inferred name:

```json
{
  "param_1" : "string_object_ptr",
  "param_2" : "search_chars",
  "param_3" : "start_pos",
  "iVar1" : "comparison_result",
  "sVar2" : "search_chars_length",
  "local_38" : "current_pos",
  "local_c" : "result_index"
}
```

Explanation:

1. **param_1**: Renamed to `string_object_ptr` because it is a pointer that is expected to point to a string object (or a similar structure where the first element is the string and the second element is the length of the string). This is inferred from its dereferencing pattern and usage in the function.

2. **param_2**: Renamed to `search_chars` as this parameter is used as a set of characters to search within the string, evident from its use in `_strncmp`.

3. **param_3**: Renamed to `start_pos` because it represents the position in the string from where the search should begin. This is based on its use in the conditional checks and loops.

4. **iVar1**: Renamed to `comparison_result` since it stores the result of the `_strncmp` function, which compares part of the main string with the `search_chars`. This variable helps decide if a match was found or not.

5. **sVar2**: Renamed to `search_chars_length` because it captures the length of `param_2` (i.e., the `search_chars`), which is essential for determining how many characters to compare during each iteration.

6. **local_38**: Renamed to `current_pos` reflecting its role in tracking the current position within the string during the search process. It is initialized to `start_pos` and incremented throughout the loop.

7. **local_c**: Renamed to `result_index`. This variable is used to store the result of the function, either the position of the first character that does not match any character in `search_chars` or an error indicator (`0xffffffff`). This indicates it is used to store the index result of the search operation.

These names provide a clearer understanding of the roles each variable plays in the function.
