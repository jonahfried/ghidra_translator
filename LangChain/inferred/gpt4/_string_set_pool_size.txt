To derive meaningful names, we need to understand the function's behavior and the context of the variables used. Here’s a detailed breakdown:

1. `param_1` and `param_2` are the function's input parameters. From the checks and usages:
   - `param_1` is checked against `NULL`, suggesting it is a pointer. Since it is dereferenced (e.g., `param_1[3]`), it seems to be a pointer to an array or a struct representing a string set with a pool for memory management.
   - `param_2` represents a size since it is compared with zero and passed to `_memory_pool_create`.

2. `lVar1` is used to store return values from functions like `_memory_pool_create` and `_memory_pool_allocate`, suggesting it's used to capture memory addresses or operation results.

3. `local_9` is used to hold the status of operations (success or failure), indicated by being set to `0` or `1` and being the return value of the function.

Given these observations, here is the mapping:

```json
{
  "param_1": "string_set",
  "param_2": "new_pool_size",
  "lVar1": "memory_address_or_result",
  "local_9": "operation_success"
}
```

### Reasoning
- `param_1` is named `string_set` because it is used like a data structure handling strings with an associated memory pool.
- `param_2` is named `new_pool_size` as it indicates the size intended for a new memory pool.
- `lVar1` is named `memory_address_or_result` because it temporarily holds memory addresses returned by memory management functions or results of such operations.
- `local_9` is named `operation_success`, as it is used to indicate whether the function's operations succeeded (`1`) or failed (`0`).

This naming provides clarity based on the function’s operations and the roles of each variable within those operations.
