The given code appears to be a function that searches for the last position in a string, where a given substring does not match, starting from a specified position. Let's break down the function and its variable usage to infer meaningful names:

1. `param_1`: This parameter is a pointer to a long, but it is used in a way that suggests it might be pointing to a structure or an array where the first element is a pointer to a string (character array) and the second element is the length of the string. This is common in custom string implementations in C. Thus:
   - `param_1` : `string_data_ptr`

2. `param_2`: This is clearly a pointer to a character array (C-string) which represents the substring to find within the main string. Hence:
   - `param_2` : `search_buffer`

3. `param_3`: This is an unsigned long integer used to specify the starting position for the search. This parameter is compared against the string length, suggesting it's an index. Therefore:
   - `param_3` : `start_position`

4. `iVar1`: This is used to store the result of `_strncmp`, which compares two strings. The result is then checked to determine if a match was found. It's essentially a temporary variable for comparison result:
   - `iVar1` : `compare_result`

5. `sVar2`: This captures the length of `param_2`, i.e., the length of the buffer or substring to be searched within the main string:
   - `sVar2` : `search_buffer_length`

6. `local_40`: This variable is initialized with `param_3` but may be adjusted based on the length of the string and the search buffer. It represents the adjusted position from which the search should start:
   - `local_40` : `adjusted_start_position`

7. `local_34`: This is clearly a loop variable that starts from `adjusted_start_position` and decrements down to 0, indicating it is the current index for the search operation:
   - `local_34` : `current_index`

Given this analysis, here is the mapping:

```json
{
  "param_1" : "string_data_ptr",
  "param_2" : "search_buffer",
  "param_3" : "start_position",
  "iVar1" : "compare_result",
  "sVar2" : "search_buffer_length",
  "local_40" : "adjusted_start_position",
  "local_34" : "current_index"
}
```

This naming scheme provides clearer insights into the roles each variable plays within the function, thereby improving the readability and maintainability of the code.
