- `param_1`: Renamed to `string_pointer` because it seems to be a pointer to a string object.
- `param_2`: Renamed to `search_string` as it is used for searching within the string.
- `param_3`: Renamed to `position` since it represents a position within the string.

- `sVar2`: Renamed to `search_string_length` to indicate it holds the length of the search string.
- `local_40`: Renamed to `adjusted_position` as it stores the adjusted position for searching.
- `local_34`: Renamed to `current_index` as it is used as the index in the loop.
