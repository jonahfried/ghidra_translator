The function `_string_concatenate` takes two parameters and appends the content of the second parameter to the first, provided neither is null. Below is the reasoning for the inferred names and types:

1. **param_1**:
   - Type: `long` (this suggests it could be a pointer in a 64-bit system where `long` and pointer sizes are typically 64 bits).
   - Usage: It is being checked if it is 0 (null) and passed to another function `_string_append` as an argument which implies it could be a pointer to some kind of string or string-like object.
   - Inferred name: `str1_ptr`

2. **param_2**:
   - Type: `undefined8 *` (indicates a pointer to an 8-byte type, likely a pointer in 64-bit systems).
   - Usage: It is checked against 0 (null), and its dereferenced value `*param_2` is used, indicating it points to some data relevant to the function `_string_append`. Given the function's name and context, it is very likely a pointer to another string or string object.
   - Inferred name: `str2_ptr`

The code also involves error handling where it checks for null pointers and prints error messages to `stderr` if either of the pointers is null, emphasizing their usage as pointers to string objects.

Mapping in the requested format:
```json
{
  "param_1": "str1_ptr",
  "param_2": "str2_ptr"
}
```

This renaming helps clarify that the function handles two string pointers and attempts to concatenate the second string to the first.
