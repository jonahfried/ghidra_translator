The function `_string_pad_right` seems to handle string padding functionality, specifically padding to the right side based on the specified total length and padding character. Here's an analysis of the variables and their purposes:

1. `param_1`: This appears to be a pointer to a string object represented in a structure or array. Given the usage, it likely contains the string, its current length, and possibly its total allocated size.
2. `param_2`: This parameter likely represents the new total length the string should have after padding.
3. `param_3`: This is the character used to pad the string.

Let's map the placeholder names to more descriptive names:

```plaintext
{
  param_1: string_object,
  param_2: target_length,
  param_3: padding_char,
  pvVar1: current_length,
  pvVar2: new_length_pointer,
  pvVar3: reallocated_memory,
}
```

### Explanation

- **string_object (`param_1`)**: This is used as a structure or array that holds the string and its metadata. It is dereferenced multiple times, indicating it stores multiple pieces of information about the string.

- **target_length (`param_2`)**: This is used to determine the new size to which the string should be padded. It appears as a target for the new length of the string.

- **padding_char (`param_3`)**: This char is used in a memset function, which is typically used for setting memory with a specific byte value, in this case, used for padding the string.

- **current_length (`pvVar1`)**: This variable is used to hold the original length of the string (extracted from `string_object[1]`) and is used in the calculation of how much new memory needs to be padded.

- **new_length_pointer (`pvVar2`)**: This variable represents the pointer to the end of the new string after padding is applied. This is calculated by adding the difference between `target_length` and `current_length` to the current length.

- **reallocated_memory (`pvVar3`)**: This stores the result of the `realloc` function, which attempts to allocate memory for the new, padded string.

Each variable name now reflects its role in the function, aiding in understanding the operation performed by the code.
