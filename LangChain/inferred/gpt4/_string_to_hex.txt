Based on the provided decompiled code, let's analyze and determine the appropriate variable names and types:

1. **_string_to_hex** Function Parameters:
   - `char *str`: The input parameter `str` seems to be a pointer to a character array, which signifies the original string that is to be converted to a hexadecimal string.
     - Inferred Name: `input_string`
     - Type: `char*`
   - `long *len`: This is likely intended to be used to either receive the length of the output string or to provide additional data (not used in this snippet). Given the typical pattern in C, this could be meant to store the output length.
     - Inferred Name: `output_length`
     - Type: `long*`

2. Local Variables:
   - `ulong uVar1`: This variable is used to store the result of `_string_empty(str)`, which checks if the string is empty.
     - Inferred Name: `is_string_empty_result`
     - Type: `ulong`
   - `undefined local_2b [3]`: This seems to be a small buffer used for formatting purposes, possibly to store two hexadecimal characters and a null terminator.
     - Inferred Name: `hex_char_buffer`
     - Type: `char[3]`
   - `ulong local_28`: Used as a loop counter, iterating over the characters of the string.
     - Inferred Name: `char_index`
     - Type: `ulong`
   - `uchar *local_20`: This appears to be a pointer to a string being constructed, initially created empty and then appended with hexadecimal characters.
     - Inferred Name: `hex_output_string`
     - Type: `uchar*`
   - `long *local_18`: This is assigned from the input parameter `str` and used as an array in the loop, thus it likely represents the pointer to the original string.
     - Inferred Name: `input_string_pointer`
     - Type: `char*`
   - `uchar *local_10`: This is the main output of the function, which is the final hexadecimal string.
     - Inferred Name: `output_hex_string`
     - Type: `uchar*`

Mapping and explanation:
```python
{
  "str": "input_string",
  "len": "output_length",
  "uVar1": "is_string_empty_result",
  "local_2b": "hex_char_buffer",
  "local_28": "char_index",
  "local_20": "hex_output_string",
  "local_18": "input_string_pointer",
  "local_10": "output_hex_string"
}
```

Each name is chosen based on the role the variable plays within the function. For example, `local_20` is named `hex_output_string` because it's used to store and build the hexadecimal representation of the input string. Similarly, the choice of `local_10` as `output_hex_string` reflects its role as the function's return value, containing the final hex string.
