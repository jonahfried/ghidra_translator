Based on the decompiled code provided, here's the mapping from placeholder names to inferred, descriptive names:

```
{
  param_1: "string_info",
  local_20: "char_index",
  local_9: "is_alpha"
}
```

**Explanation:**

1. **param_1**:
   - The function checks if `param_1` is null and also uses it in a loop that seems to iterate over characters of a string.
   - The use of `param_1[1]` suggests it might be pointing to a structure or an array where the second element (index 1) holds the length of the string.
   - The `*param_1` is likely a pointer to the string itself.
   - Hence, the name `string_info` is chosen, suggesting it's a pointer to a structure or array containing string-related data.

2. **local_20**:
   - This variable is used as a loop counter to index through each character in the string.
   - It starts at 0 and increments until it reaches the length of the string (`param_1[1]`).
   - The name `char_index` is descriptive of its role as an index for characters in the string.

3. **local_9**:
   - This variable is used to store the result of the function, which is either 0 or 1.
   - The function appears to check if all characters in the string are alphabetic (both lowercase and uppercase checks are performed).
   - If any character is not alphabetic, it immediately returns 0. If all characters are alphabetic, it sets `local_9` to 1 before returning.
   - The name `is_alpha` is thus appropriate as it indicates whether the string is entirely alphabetic.

Each inferred name enhances readability and understanding of the code, providing clarity on the purpose and usage of each variable within the function.
