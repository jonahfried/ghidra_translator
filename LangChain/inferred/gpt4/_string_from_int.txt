Here's the mapping for the provided code based on context and functionality:

```
{
  "param_1": "input_integer",
  "uVar1": "result_string",
  "local_1c": "formatted_string_buffer",
  "local_10": "stack_check_original"
}
```

Explanation of each inferred name:

1. **param_1**: The function is named `_string_from_int`, suggesting it takes an integer and converts it to a string. Thus, `param_1` is the integer input to this function. Naming it `input_integer` makes its purpose clear.

2. **uVar1**: This variable holds the return value from `_string_create`, which appears to take a string (formed by formatting `param_1`) and possibly creates a new string object or similar structure. Given that it's returned by the function, naming it `result_string` explains that it stores the resultant string object derived from the input integer.

3. **local_1c**: This local array is used as the target buffer in the `___sprintf_chk` function call, where `param_1` is formatted as a string (denoted by `"%d"`). The name `formatted_string_buffer` clearly describes its role as a buffer to store the formatted string version of `input_integer`.

4. **local_10**: This variable is used to store the original value of a stack check guard (likely for detecting stack corruption or overflows). It's checked again at the end of the function to ensure it hasn't changed, which if it has, triggers `___stack_chk_fail` to indicate a stack overflow or corruption. Naming it `stack_check_original` indicates that this variable holds the original reference value for the stack check.

This mapping and naming scheme enhances the readability and maintainability of the code by clearly describing the purpose and use of each variable.
