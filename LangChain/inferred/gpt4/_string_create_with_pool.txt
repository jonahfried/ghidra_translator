{
  param_1: memory_pool,
  puVar1: string_ptr,
}
Reasoning:
- `param_1` is the input parameter for the function, which is used as the memory pool for string creation. The name `memory_pool` is descriptive and concise.
- `puVar1` is a pointer that points to the allocated memory for the string object. It is commonly used as a temporary variable to hold memory addresses or pointers. The name `string_ptr` indicates that it is a pointer to a string object.
