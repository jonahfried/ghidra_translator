From the provided decompiled code, we can infer meaningful names for each variable and constant based on their usage and context in the function `_string_create_with_pool`. Here's the analysis leading to the mapping:

1. **`puVar1`** - This variable is used to store the result of a memory allocation (`_malloc`) and is returned at the end of the function. This suggests it's the newly created object, likely a string object since the function is related to string creation. 
   - Inferred name: `new_string`
   - Type: `undefined8*` (pointer to an 8-byte undefined type, likely struct or object)

2. **`param_1`** - This is a parameter passed to `_init_global_memory_pool`. It suggests that it might be a configuration or initialization parameter for the memory pool.
   - Inferred name: `init_param`
   - Type: `undefined8` (8-byte undefined type, could be a pointer or an integer)

3. **`_string_create_with_pool_counter`** - This global variable seems to keep track of the number of times the string creation function has been called, specifically used to ensure the memory pool is initialized only once.
   - Inferred name: `string_create_count`
   - Type: Global integer variable

4. **`_global_pool`** - Used at the end of the function to set `puVar1[3]`, and checked for being non-zero after initialization. This is clearly a reference to a globally managed memory pool used for string objects.
   - Inferred name: `global_memory_pool`
   - Type: Global pointer

5. **`PTR____stderrp_10000a038`** - This placeholder seems to represent a pointer to the standard error file stream (`stderr`). It's used to print error messages.
   - Inferred name: `stderr_ptr`
   - Type: Pointer to `FILE*`

6. **`_fprintf`** - Standard library function to print formatted output to a stream like `stderr`.
   - Inferred name: Not changed (standard function name)

7. **`_exit`** - Standard library function to terminate the program.
   - Inferred name: Not changed (standard function name)

8. **`_malloc`** - Standard library function for memory allocation.
   - Inferred name: Not changed (standard function name)

The mapping in the required format would thus be:
```json
{
  "puVar1": "new_string",
  "param_1": "init_param",
  "_string_create_with_pool_counter": "string_create_count",
  "_global_pool": "global_memory_pool",
  "PTR____stderrp_10000a038": "stderr_ptr"
}
```

Each name was derived based on the usage within the function, aiming for clarity and context relevance. The types are inferred based on typical usage patterns in C/C++ for similar constructs.
