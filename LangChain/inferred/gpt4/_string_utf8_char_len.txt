Here is the mapping of the placeholder variable names to more descriptive names based on the context of the code:

```json
{
  "param_1": "first_byte",
  "local_10": "utf8_char_length"
}
```

### Reasoning:

1. **param_1**: 
   - This parameter is named `param_1` in the function signature, but based on the operations performed on it, it's clear that it represents the first byte of a potential UTF-8 encoded character. 
   - UTF-8 characters are determined by their first byte, which indicates the number of bytes the character consists of. Thus, renaming it to `first_byte` adds clarity.

2. **local_10**: 
   - This local variable, initially named `local_10`, is used to store the length of the UTF-8 encoded character determined by the value of `first_byte`. 
   - The function checks the pattern of bits in `first_byte` to decide the length (from 1 to 4 bytes) or returns 0 if the byte does not conform to any expected UTF-8 starting byte patterns.
   - Renaming this to `utf8_char_length` directly reflects its role in storing the length of the character, making the code more understandable.

### Additional Explanation of Code Logic:

- The function `_string_utf8_char_len` determines the number of bytes that make up a UTF-8 character based on its first byte.
- It uses bitwise AND operations combined with comparisons to check the leading bits of the byte:
  - `0xxxxxxx` for 1-byte characters.
  - `110xxxxx` for 2-byte characters.
  - `1110xxxx` for 3-byte characters.
  - `11110xxx` for 4-byte characters.
- The function returns the character length accordingly, helping in decoding UTF-8 encoded data.
