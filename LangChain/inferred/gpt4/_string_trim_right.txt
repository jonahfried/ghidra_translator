- `param_1`: Renamed to `string_pointer` since it seems to be pointing to a string object.
- `iVar1`: Renamed to `space_check_result` to indicate its purpose of checking if a character is a space.
- `bVar2`: Renamed to `is_space` to indicate its purpose of storing whether a character is a space or not.
- `local_18`: Renamed to `current_length` to clarify that it is holding the current length of the string being trimmed.
