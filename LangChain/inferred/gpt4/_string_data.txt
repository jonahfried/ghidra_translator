In the provided function `_string_data`, we can infer the purpose and meaningful names for the variables and parameters based on their usage within the function:

1. `long *param_1`:
   - **Usage**: This parameter is checked against `NULL` and dereferenced to obtain a value.
   - **Inferred Name and Type**: `string_object_pointer`, type: `long *`
   - **Reasoning**: Given the checks and dereferencing, it seems `param_1` is a pointer to a long value or structure representing a string object in memory. The name `string_object_pointer` reflects that it is a pointer to some kind of structured data representing a string.

2. `long local_10`:
   - **Usage**: This local variable stores a value conditionally based on the validity of `param_1` and is returned by the function.
   - **Inferred Name and Type**: `string_data_or_zero`, type: `long`
   - **Reasoning**: `local_10` is used to either store a dereferenced value from `param_1` or zero if `param_1` is invalid. The name `string_data_or_zero` indicates that this variable will either hold valid string data or zero, depending on the input condition.

3. Reference to `*(FILE **)PTR____stderrp_10000a038`:
   - **Usage**: Used as a parameter in a function `_fprintf` for error logging.
   - **Inferred Name and Type**: This is a placeholder for a pointer to the standard error file handle.
   - **Reasoning**: Although not a variable we need to rename, understanding that this is a reference to `stderr` helps clarify the error handling aspect of the function.

Mapping in the requested format:
```json
{
  "param_1": "string_object_pointer",
  "local_10": "string_data_or_zero"
}
```

This mapping and naming are designed to provide clarity to the function's behavior, which involves checking the validity of a string object pointer and returning either its data or zero. The names were chosen to be descriptive and indicative of their roles within the function.
