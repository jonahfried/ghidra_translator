Here's a mapping of the placeholder variable names to more descriptive and concise names, based on the context in which they are used in the decompiled code:

```python
{
  "param_1": "input_string_ptr",
  "param_2": "delimiter",
  "param_3": "token_count_ptr",
  "pcVar1": "str_duplicate",
  "uVar2": "new_string",
  "local_58": "dealloc_index",
  "local_50": "token_index",
  "local_40": "current_token",
  "local_30": "token_count",
  "local_10": "token_array"
}
```

### Explanation of Reasoning for Each Name:
1. **param_1**: This parameter is an `undefined8 *` type, which indicates it's a pointer. It looks like the original string being tokenized, hence renamed as `input_string_ptr`.

2. **param_2**: This is a `char *` type and is used as the second argument to `_strtok`, which is typically a string of delimiters. Thus, it's renamed to `delimiter`.

3. **param_3**: This is an `undefined4 *` type and receives the count of tokens found, so it's named `token_count_ptr`.

4. **pcVar1**: This local variable is used to store the result of `_string_strdup` and is used in tokenization and memory operations, so `str_duplicate` is a fitting name suggesting itâ€™s a duplicate of a string.

5. **uVar2**: It represents a new string created from `current_token` by `_string_create`. The name `new_string` fits as it indicates the operation performed on it.

6. **local_58**: This is used as an index in a loop to deallocate strings, so `dealloc_index` is a descriptive name indicating its purpose.

7. **local_50**: This variable tracks the current index in the token array, thus `token_index` is an appropriate name.

8. **local_40**: Used to store each token obtained from `_strtok`. The name `current_token` clearly describes what it holds.

9. **local_30**: It keeps a count of how many tokens have been identified, hence named `token_count`.

10. **local_10**: This seems to be a pointer to an array of tokens (or memory allocated for tokens), so `token_array` is a descriptive name reflecting its usage.

This nomenclature not only makes the code more readable but also helps in understanding the functionality of the code better by providing contextually meaningful names.
