}
Reasoning:
- `param_1` is used as the input string that is being tokenized.
- `param_2` represents the delimiter used for tokenizing the string.
- `param_3` is assigned the number of tokens found in the string.
- `pcVar1` is a pointer to the tokenized string obtained using `_string_strdup`.
- `uVar2` represents an individual token created using `_string_create`.
- `local_58` is used as a loop counter for the outer loop.
- `local_50` is used as the index for storing tokens in the token array.
- `local_40` represents an individual token during tokenization.
- `local_30` stores the total number of tokens found in the string.
- `local_10` represents the array storing all the tokens extracted from the input string.
