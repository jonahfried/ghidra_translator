In the provided function `_string_end`, let's analyze the purpose and behavior of the variables and parameters to assign more descriptive names:

1. **`param_1`** - This parameter is a pointer, and it is checked against NULL and dereferenced. Given the context of the function name `_string_end` and its operations, it is likely that `param_1` is a pointer to a data structure related to strings. The check `(*param_1 == 0)` suggests it could be checking the first element of what might be a structure containing string data. If we consider `param_1[1]` as well, it appears that `param_1` points to some structure where:
   - `*param_1` (or `param_1[0]`) might represent the start of a string or a similar character sequence.
   - `param_1[1]` could represent the length or end offset of the string.
   Thus, a more descriptive name could be `string_info` or `string_data`.

2. **`local_10`** - This local variable holds the result of the function, which is computed as `*param_1 + param_1[1]`. Given the function's name and its computation, `local_10` seems to represent the end position of a string when it exists. A more descriptive name could be `string_end_position`.

3. **`PTR____stderrp_10000a038`** - This pointer is used to reference `stderr`, where an error message is printed if the input is invalid or `NULL`. We don't need to rename it as it is a pointer to a standard error output stream, but if a descriptive name were required, it could be something like `stderr_ptr`.

4. **`_fprintf`** - This is a function to write formatted output to streams, here specifically used to write to `stderr`. The name is standard and does not require renaming.

Mapping the placeholders to descriptive names, we have:
```json
{
  "param_1" : "string_data",
  "local_10" : "string_end_position"
}
```

Overall, the function checks if `string_data` is `NULL` or points to an empty structure (first element is zero). If invalid, it logs an error message and sets the `string_end_position` to 0. Otherwise, it calculates the end position of the string by adding the start position or base address (`*string_data`) to a length or offset (`string_data[1]`). The result is returned as the computed string end position.
