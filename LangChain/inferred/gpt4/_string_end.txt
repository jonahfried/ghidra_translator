{
  param_1 : input_pointer,
  local_10 : result,
}
- `param_1`: Renamed to `input_pointer` as it is a pointer to the input array.
- `local_10`: Renamed to `result` as it stores the result of the computation in the function.

The renaming is based on the context and the usage of the variables in the function.
