- `string_buffer`: Represents the buffer where the string is stored. It's more descriptive than `param_1`.
- `insertion_position`: Describes the position where the `str_item` will be inserted.
- `str_item`: Represents the string that will be inserted.
- `str_item_length`: Describes the length of the `str_item`, which is obtained using `_strlen`.
- `new_buffer_length`: Represents the new length of the buffer after insertion.
- `new_buffer_address`: Represents the address of the newly allocated buffer if reallocation is needed.
