The code provided is a function for inserting a string (`param_3`) into another string at a specific position (`param_2`) within a string object represented by a pointer to a long array (`param_1`). Here's a breakdown to create a mapping of placeholder variable names to more descriptive names:

1. **param_1**: This is a pointer to a long, and from the usage, it seems that `param_1` is a structure representing a string object. The structure appears to be:
   - `param_1[0]` points to the actual character data (string).
   - `param_1[1]` is the current length of the string.
   - `param_1[2]` is the capacity of the string (maximum size before needing to reallocate).
   - `param_1[3]` might be a memory pool or similar resource from which memory can be allocated.
   
   Mapping:
   ```json
   {
     "param_1": "string_object"
   }
   ```

2. **param_2**: This parameter represents the position within the string at which `param_3` should be inserted.

   Mapping:
   ```json
   {
     "param_2": "insert_position"
   }
   ```

3. **param_3**: This is clearly the string to be inserted.

   Mapping:
   ```json
   {
     "param_3": "insert_string"
   }
   ```

4. **sVar1**: This variable holds the result of `_strlen(param_3)`, which is the length of the string to be inserted.

   Mapping:
   ```json
   {
     "sVar1": "insert_length"
   }
   ```

5. **lVar2**: This is used to hold the new length of the string after the insertion of `param_3`.

   Mapping:
   ```json
   {
     "lVar2": "new_length"
   }
   ```

6. **lVar3**: This is used as a temporary variable when allocating new memory for the string when the existing capacity is not enough. It seems to hold the new memory address allocated from the memory pool.

   Mapping:
   ```json
   {
     "lVar3": "new_memory_address"
   }
   ```

The function checks for null pointers and bounds errors before performing the insertion. If the capacity (`param_1[2]`) is insufficient to hold the new string length, it allocates new memory, copies the old and new strings into the right positions, and updates the string object's pointers and size. If there is enough capacity, it simply moves parts of the original string and copies the new string into place.

Mapping in JSON format:

```json
{
  "param_1": "string_object",
  "param_2": "insert_position",
  "param_3": "insert_string",
  "sVar1": "insert_length",
  "lVar2": "new_length",
  "lVar3": "new_memory_address"
}
```
