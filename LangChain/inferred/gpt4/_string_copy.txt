The function `_string_copy` appears to be designed for copying a substring from a source string to a destination buffer. Let’s analyze each parameter and variable to determine their appropriate names and types:

### Parameters:
1. **`long *param_1`**:
    - This appears to be a pointer to a structure or array related to the source string, as it is dereferenced multiple times in the function (`*param_1` and `param_1[1]`). The first element is used directly as a string (`*param_1`), and the second element is treated as a length or size (`param_1[1]`).
    - **Suggested name and type**: `{ "param_1": "source_string_info", "type": "long*" }`

2. **`long param_2`**:
    - This is used as the destination buffer where the string is copied. It is checked against `0` to ensure it is not `NULL`, and it is passed to `___strncpy_chk` as the destination.
    - **Suggested name and type**: `{ "param_2": "destination_buffer", "type": "long" }`

3. **`ulong param_3`**:
    - This parameter is used as an offset or starting index into the source string data (`*param_1 + param_3`).
    - **Suggested name and type**: `{ "param_3": "copy_start_index", "type": "ulong" }`

4. **`long param_4`**:
    - This parameter seems to specify the maximum number of characters to copy. It’s used to calculate `local_38` which holds the actual number of characters to be copied.
    - **Suggested name and type**: `{ "param_4": "max_chars_to_copy", "type": "long" }`

### Local Variables:

1. **`long local_38`**:
    - This variable holds the actual number of characters to be copied. It is calculated based on the source string length, starting position, and `param_4`.
    - **Suggested name and type**: `{ "local_38": "num_chars_copied", "type": "long" }`

2. **`long local_10`**:
    - This variable seems to function as the return value, which represents the number of characters copied, or `0` in case of an error.
    - **Suggested name and type**: `{ "local_10": "copy_result", "type": "long" }`

### Summary of Inferred Names and Types:

```json
{
  "param_1": "source_string_info",
  "param_2": "destination_buffer",
  "param_3": "copy_start_index",
  "param_4": "max_chars_to_copy",
  "local_38": "num_chars_copied",
  "local_10": "copy_result"
}
```

These names reflect the purposes of the variables and parameters within the context of a function designed to copy a portion of a string to a buffer, ensuring a semantic understanding of the codebase for future maintenance or development.
