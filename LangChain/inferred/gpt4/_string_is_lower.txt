}
- `param_1`: Renamed to `string_pointer` because it seems to be a pointer to a string.
- `local_20`: Renamed to `index` because it is used as an index in a loop.
- `local_9`: Renamed to `is_lower_case` because it likely holds a boolean value indicating whether the string contains only lowercase characters.
