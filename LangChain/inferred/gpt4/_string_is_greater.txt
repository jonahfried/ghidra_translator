{
  param_1: str_1_addr,
  param_2: str_2_addr,
  iVar1: comparison_result,
}
Reasoning:
- `param_1`: Represents the address of the first string being compared.
- `param_2`: Represents the address of the second string being compared.
- `iVar1`: Holds the result of the comparison operation, hence `comparison_result`.
