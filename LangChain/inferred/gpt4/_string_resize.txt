{
  param_1 : string_buffer,
  param_2 : new_size,
  lVar1 : new_buffer_address,
}
- `param_1`: Renamed to `string_buffer` to indicate that it represents a buffer storing a string.
- `param_2`: Renamed to `new_size` to indicate that it represents the new size that the string buffer should be resized to.
- `lVar1`: Renamed to `new_buffer_address` to indicate that it stores the address of a newly allocated buffer.

The reasoning behind each inferred name is to give a clear and concise representation of the purpose and usage of each variable based on its context within the function.
