{

  local_1c : str_length,
}
}

- `param_1` : The function parameter `param_1` appears to be an array representing a string. Renaming it to `input_arr` indicates that it is an input array.
  
- `pvVar1` : The variable `pvVar1` is assigned the reversed string. Renaming it to `reversed_str` clarifies its purpose in holding the reversed string.

- `uVar2` : The variable `uVar2` is likely holding a converted C-style string. Renaming it to `c_str` is a common abbreviation for C-style strings.

- `local_20` : The variable `local_20` seems to be used as an index for iterating over the string characters. Renaming it to `index` describes its purpose more clearly.

- `local_1c` : The variable `local_1c` appears to store the length of the string. Renaming it to `str_length` describes its purpose accurately.
