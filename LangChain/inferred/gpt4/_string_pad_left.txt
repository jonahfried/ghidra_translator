In the provided decompiled function `_string_pad_left`, several placeholder variable names can be inferred based on the usage within the function. Here is the analysis of each variable and the inferred names:

1. **param_1**: This parameter seems to be a pointer to a structure or array that represents a string object. It is used to access multiple elements like `param_1[1]` and elements are manipulated and checked. Thus, a more descriptive name would be `string_obj`.

2. **param_2**: This parameter is used in calculations involving the length of a string, implying it's the desired total length of the string after padding. Therefore, a better name would be `total_length`.

3. **param_3**: This character parameter is used as the fill value in the memory set function (`___memset_chk`). It appears to be the padding character, so a suitable name would be `pad_char`.

4. **lVar1**: This variable holds the result of a length calculation, specifically the difference between the desired total length and the current length. A more descriptive name would be `padding_length`.

5. **pvVar2**: This variable calculates the new length of the string object after padding. Hence, `new_length` would be an appropriate name.

6. **pvVar3**: This variable is used to store the address returned by `_malloc`, which is intended to be the new memory allocation for the padded string. Thus, `new_string_memory` is a descriptive name.

The full mapping in the required format:
```json
{
  "param_1": "string_obj",
  "param_2": "total_length",
  "param_3": "pad_char",
  "lVar1": "padding_length",
  "pvVar2": "new_length",
  "pvVar3": "new_string_memory"
}
```

### Reasoning:

- **string_obj** (`param_1`): It's treated like a structure or array handling string data, with multiple elements accessed and modified.
- **total_length** (`param_2`): Directly used in length calculations, representing the desired string length after padding.
- **pad_char** (`param_3`): Used as the fill character in `___memset_chk` to set the padding bytes.
- **padding_length** (`lVar1`): Computed as the difference needed to reach `total_length` from the current length, representing how much padding is needed.
- **new_length** (`pvVar2`): Represents the computed new length of the string after adding padding.
- **new_string_memory** (`pvVar3`): Points to the newly allocated memory meant to hold the padded string, indicating its use as storage for the resultant string.
