- `param_1`: Renamed to `string_array` as it seems to be an array containing information about a string.
- `param_2`: Renamed to `desired_length` as it represents the length that the string needs to be padded to.
- `param_3`: Renamed to `pad_character` as it represents the character used for padding.
- `lVar1`: Renamed to `length_difference` as it calculates the difference in length for padding.
- `pvVar2`: Renamed to `new_length` as it represents the new length of the string after padding.
- `pvVar3`: Renamed to `new_string` as it holds the newly created padded string.
