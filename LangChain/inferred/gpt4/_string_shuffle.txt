{
  param_1 : input_string,
  cVar1 : temp_char,
  iVar2 : random_index,
  tVar3 : current_time,
  uVar4 : string_length,
  local_20 : index,
}
Reasoning:
- `param_1`: This variable is a pointer to a string, representing the input string that needs to be shuffled.
- `cVar1`: This variable is used as a temporary storage for a character during the shuffling process.
- `iVar2`: This variable is used to store a random index generated for shuffling the characters in the string.
- `tVar3`: This variable is used to store the current time, likely for seeding the random number generator.
- `uVar4`: This variable is used to store the length of the input string.
- `local_20`: This variable is used as an index for iterating through the string during shuffling.
