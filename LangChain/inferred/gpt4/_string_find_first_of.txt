- `param_1`: Renamed to `string_data_ptr` as it seems to be a pointer to some string data.
- `param_2`: Renamed to `search_char_ptr` as it seems to be a pointer to a character to search for.
- `param_3`: Renamed to `search_start_index` as it seems to be an index indicating where to start the search.
- `pcVar1`: Renamed to `found_char_ptr` as it seems to be a pointer to a found character.
- `local_c`: Renamed to `result_index` as it appears to store the index of the found character or -1 if not found.
