{
  param_1 : ptr_to_string,
  bVar1 : is_empty,
}
Reasoning:
- `param_1`: The parameter seems to be a pointer to a string, so `ptr_to_string` is a descriptive name that indicates it's a pointer to a string.
- `bVar1`: This variable is used to store whether the string is empty or not based on the condition. `is_empty` is a concise and descriptive name that conveys the purpose of this variable.
