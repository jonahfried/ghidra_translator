From the given decompiled function `_string_empty`, let's analyze and map each placeholder variable and parameter name to more descriptive ones.

1. `param_1`: This variable represents the first and only parameter passed to the function. Given that the function name is `_string_empty`, and the way this parameter is being used, it suggests that `param_1` is likely a pointer to a string or a similar data structure. In C or C++, strings can be represented as structures containing metadata such as length or capacity. The check `param_1 == 0` (null pointer check) and access operation `*(long *)(param_1 + 8)` further hints that this is a pointer to a structure, possibly a string-like object where `param_1 + 8` could be accessing the length or size field of the string. Therefore, a better name would be `string_ptr`.

2. `bVar1`: This variable holds the boolean result of the check performed in the function. The function checks whether the string is empty and returns a boolean result accordingly. Therefore, a more descriptive name for `bVar1` would be `is_empty`.

Revised variable names and mapping based on the analysis:
```json
{
  "param_1" : "string_ptr",
  "bVar1" : "is_empty"
}
```

Explanation:
- `string_ptr`: A pointer to a string or a similar object, indicating the input to the function. The pointer is checked for null and its contents are used to determine if the string is empty.
- `is_empty`: A boolean value representing whether the string pointed to by `string_ptr` is empty or not. This is the final result returned by the function.
