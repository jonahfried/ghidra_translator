This function, `_string_swap`, appears to swap contents of two string objects. Hereâ€™s the mapping of placeholder variable names to more descriptive names based on the context:

```json
{
  "param_1": "first_string",
  "param_2": "second_string",
  "uVar1": "temp_first_string_part0",
  "uVar2": "temp_first_string_part1",
  "uVar3": "temp_first_string_part2",
  "uVar4": "temp_first_string_part3"
}
```

### Reasoning:

1. **`param_1` and `param_2`**: These are pointers to the data of two string-like objects (most likely structures holding strings or similar data). Given that the function is named `_string_swap`, it implies these parameters represent strings or string-like structures. The naming as `first_string` and `second_string` makes it clear which is being referenced.

2. **`uVar1` to `uVar4`**: These variables are used to temporarily hold the data from `first_string` during the swap operation. The operation involves copying the contents from `first_string` to these temporary variables, then overwriting `first_string`'s data with `second_string`'s data, and finally copying the data from the temporary variables to `second_string`. The naming such as `temp_first_string_part0` to `temp_first_string_part3` reflects their role in holding parts of the first string during the swap. Each part (from 0 to 3) represents a segment of the `first_string` data, assuming the string or string-like structure is divided into four parts (likely due to the way the data is structured or managed in memory).

This naming convention provides a clearer understanding of the role each variable plays in the context of the function, enhancing readability and maintainability of the code.
