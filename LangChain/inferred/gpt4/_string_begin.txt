{
  param_1 : input_pointer,
  local_10 : result_string,
}
Explanation:
- `param_1`: This variable represents the input parameter of the function, which is a pointer to a pointer to a character (char **). The name `input_pointer` is chosen to indicate that it is a pointer holding some input data.
- `local_10`: This variable is used to store the result string that will be returned by the function. The name `result_string` is chosen to indicate that it holds the resulting string value that will be returned.
