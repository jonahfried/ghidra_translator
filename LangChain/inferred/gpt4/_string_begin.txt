From the provided code snippet, we can observe the functionality and deduce the purpose of the variables involved. The function `_string_begin` appears to return the beginning of a string from a provided pointer to a pointer of char data type, handling error scenarios where the input pointers might be null. Hereâ€™s the inferred mapping of placeholder variable names to descriptive names and their types:

```json
{
  "param_1": "string_ptr",
  "local_10": "result_string"
}
```

### Explanation of each inferred name:

1. **param_1**: This is the input parameter of the function, which is a pointer to a pointer of `char`. This suggests that it could be pointing to a string (array of characters) or an array of strings. Given the context where it checks if `param_1` or `*param_1` is null and the operation `local_10 = *param_1;`, it's clear that `param_1` is intended to handle a pointer to a string. Therefore, a more descriptive name could be `string_ptr` which indicates that it points to a string.

2. **local_10**: This local variable is used to store the result which is then returned by the function. Initially, it can hold an empty string `""` in error cases, or the beginning of the input string as pointed to by `*param_1`. Naming it `result_string` provides clarity on its purpose as the storage for the output of this function.

These names enhance the readability of the code by more clearly stating the purpose and types of the variables, which is particularly helpful for maintaining and understanding the code in larger projects.
