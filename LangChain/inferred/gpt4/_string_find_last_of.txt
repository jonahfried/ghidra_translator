- `param_1`: Renamed to `string_array` as it seems to be a pointer to an array of strings.
- `param_2`: Renamed to `target_char` as it appears to be a pointer to a character that is being searched for in the string array.
- `param_3`: Renamed to `position` as it likely indicates a specific position in the string array.
- `bVar1`: Renamed to `is_within_bounds` to reflect its purpose of checking if a position is within bounds.
- `local_38`: Renamed to `found_position` since it seems to hold the current position of the target character in the string array.
- `local_2c`: Renamed to `last_found_position` to indicate it stores the last found position of the target character.
- `local_c`: Renamed to `result` as it is the final result of the function.
