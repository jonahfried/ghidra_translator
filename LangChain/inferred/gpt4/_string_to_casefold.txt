In this code snippet `_string_to_casefold`, we are given a function that is intended to convert a string to casefold, which is similar to converting to all lowercase. Let's analyze each variable and assign meaningful names:

1. **param_1**: This is a pointer to a long type, but given its usage, it appears to be a pointer to some structure or array related to a string. The first element (`*param_1`) points to the string itself, and the second element (`param_1[1]`) is likely the length of the string. Hence, a better name would be `string_info`.

2. **iVar1**: This is an integer variable used to store the result of the `_tolower` function, which converts a character to lowercase. A more descriptive name would be `lowercase_char`.

3. **local_18**: This variable is used as a loop counter to iterate over the characters in the string. It is better named as `char_index`.

The mapping and reasoning in the specified format would be:
```json
{
  "param_1" : "string_info",
  "iVar1" : "lowercase_char",
  "local_18" : "char_index"
}
```

### Explanation:
- **string_info**: This name is chosen because `param_1` is used to access both the string and its length, implying it holds information about the string.
- **lowercase_char**: The variable `iVar1` is used to temporarily hold the lowercase version of each character in the string, hence this name is straightforward and descriptive.
- **char_index**: `local_18` serves as the index for the current character being processed in the string, so this name accurately reflects its role.
