Here is the mapping from placeholder variable names to descriptive, concise names based on the context of the given code:

```json
{
  "param_1" : "input_string_ptr",
  "local_30" : "input_index",
  "local_28" : "bit_index",
  "local_24" : "bit_accumulator",
  "local_10" : "encoded_string"
}
```

**Explanation:**

1. **param_1**: This variable seems to be a pointer to a string or a similar data structure where the first element points to the actual data string and the second element (param_1[1]) contains the length of the string. Renaming it to `input_string_ptr` gives a better understanding that this is a pointer to the input string being encoded.

2. **local_30**: Used as a loop variable iterating from 0 to the length of the data (param_1[1]). Renaming it to `input_index` captures its role in indexing over each byte of the input data.

3. **local_28**: This variable is used to manage the number of bits processed from the input data in the context of encoding to base64, which works on 6-bit groups. It is adjusted accordingly within the loop. Renaming it to `bit_index` expresses its usage as tracking the current bit position within the byte being processed.

4. **local_24**: This variable accumulates bit values from the input data. It's shifted and updated in a way that allows grouping bits into 6-bit segments suitable for base64 encoding. Renaming it to `bit_accumulator` clearly reflects its role in accumulating bits before they are converted into base64 characters.

5. **local_10**: This is a variable holding a reference or a pointer to a new string that is created to hold the base64 encoded result. It is then returned at the end of the function. Thus, renaming it to `encoded_string` makes its purpose clear, indicating that this variable will ultimately hold the base64-encoded version of the input string.

By renaming these variables, the code becomes more self-explanatory, enhancing readability and maintainability.
