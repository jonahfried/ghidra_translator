The decompiled function `_string_from_hex` converts a hexadecimal string into its corresponding ASCII string. Here is the mapping and reasoning for each placeholder variable:

```json
{
  "param_1": "input_string_ptr",
  "uVar1": "is_empty_result",
  "lVar2": "ascii_char",
  "local_2b": "hex_char1",
  "local_2a": "hex_char2",
  "local_29": "null_terminator",
  "local_28": "index",
  "local_20": "output_string",
  "local_18": "string_ptr",
  "local_10": "result_string"
}
```

### Reasoning Behind Each Name:
1. **param_1**: It's a pointer passed as a parameter, likely to a string or similar construct (`input_string_ptr`).
2. **uVar1**: This variable holds the result of `_string_empty`, which suggests it's checking if the string is empty (`is_empty_result`).
3. **lVar2**: This local variable receives the result of `_strtol`, which is used to convert hexadecimal characters into ASCII characters (`ascii_char`).
4. **local_2b**: This character is used to store the first hexadecimal character of a pair (`hex_char1`).
5. **local_2a**: This character is used to store the second hexadecimal character of a pair (`hex_char2`).
6. **local_29**: Set to zero likely to null-terminate the string for conversion (`null_terminator`).
7. **local_28**: Used as an index in the loop that iterates over the hexadecimal string (`index`).
8. **local_20**: This variable appears to be a pointer to the newly created output string where the ASCII characters are being pushed (`output_string`).
9. **local_18**: Similar to `param_1`, it's used to reference the original input string more locally within the function (`string_ptr`).
10. **local_10**: Ultimately used to return the result, which is the new ASCII string created from the hexadecimal input (`result_string`).

This mapping helps in understanding the role of each variable within the function, clarifying their usage and purpose, which is crucial for further debugging or modifying the function.
