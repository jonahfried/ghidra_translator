From the provided code snippet, we can derive more descriptive and meaningful names for the variables and parameters, based on their usage throughout the function. The function appears to be designed for splitting a string into tokens based on a given delimiter and returning an array of these tokens. Here is the mapping with explanations:

```json
{
  "param_1": "input_string_ptr",
  "param_2": "delimiter",
  "param_3": "token_count_ptr",
  "pcVar1": "temp_string",
  "uVar2": "new_string",
  "local_58": "cleanup_index",
  "local_50": "token_index",
  "local_40": "current_token",
  "local_30": "total_tokens",
  "local_10": "result_array"
}
```

**Explanation:**

1. **param_1** (`input_string_ptr`): This pointer probably points to the actual string intended to be split. It is first passed to `_string_strdup` suggesting it holds a string.

2. **param_2** (`delimiter`): This parameter is used as the delimiter in `_strtok`, which splits strings based on delimiters. Naming it `delimiter` makes its purpose clear.

3. **param_3** (`token_count_ptr`): This is set at the end of the function to the number of tokens found (`local_30`), indicating it's intended to hold the output count of tokens.

4. **pcVar1** (`temp_string`): This variable is used to create a mutable copy of the input string to use with `_strtok`, which modifies the string it processes.

5. **uVar2** (`new_string`): Represents a newly created string object from `current_token`. It is stored in the `result_array`.

6. **local_58** (`cleanup_index`): Used in a loop to iterate and clean up string objects in case of an error after some have been created, suggesting its use as an index for cleanup.

7. **local_50** (`token_index`): This is used to index into the result array of strings, indicating its role as the index for each token processed.

8. **local_40** (`current_token`): Holds the result from `_strtok`, which represents the current token being processed from the string.

9. **local_30** (`total_tokens`): Keeps count of the total number of tokens found during the tokenization process.

10. **local_10** (`result_array`): This pointer is used to store the result, pointing to an array of strings (tokens). This variable is returned by the function, so it holds the final output.

The names chosen aim to reflect the variable's role and usage in the function, improving code readability and maintainability.
