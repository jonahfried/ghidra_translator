Here is the mapping of the placeholder variable names to more descriptive names, along with the reasoning behind each choice:

```json
{
  "_string_find": "string_find",
  "param_1": "string_object",
  "param_2": "search_buffer",
  "param_3": "start_position",
  "local_c": "result_index",
  "pcVar1": "found_position"
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **_string_find → string_find**: 
   - This appears to be a function that searches for a substring within a string starting from a specified position. The name "string_find" is more descriptive of this operation.

2. **param_1 → string_object**:
   - The function checks if `param_1` is null or if it points to a null value, indicating that it represents a complex structure (possibly a string object) rather than a simple integer or pointer. The name "string_object" suggests it could be a pointer to a structure representing the string and its metadata.

3. **param_2 → search_buffer**:
   - This parameter is used directly in a string search function (`_strstr`), implying that it is the buffer or string that we are searching for within `string_object`. The term "search_buffer" clearly denotes its purpose.

4. **param_3 → start_position**:
   - This parameter is compared against `string_object[1]` and used as an offset in a pointer arithmetic expression, suggesting it indicates the position within the string from which the search should start. The name "start_position" accurately reflects this role.

5. **local_c → result_index**:
   - This local variable holds the result of the string search operation, specifically the index at which the search string (`search_buffer`) is found. If not found, it is set to -1. Naming it "result_index" makes its purpose clear.

6. **pcVar1 → found_position**:
   - This variable captures the pointer returned by `_strstr`, which represents the position within the string where `search_buffer` starts. The name "found_position" effectively describes what this variable represents.

This mapping translates the cryptic placeholder names to more meaningful names that enhance the readability and maintainability of the code, making it easier to understand the function’s purpose and mechanics.
