- `param_1`: Renamed to `string_ptr` as it seems to be pointing to a string object being trimmed.
- `iVar1`: Renamed to `isspace_result` as it likely stores the result of the `_isspace` function.
- `bVar2`: Renamed to `is_whitespace` as it seems to be a boolean flag indicating if the character at a specific index is whitespace.
- `local_18`: Renamed to `trim_index` as it appears to track the index of the character being checked for trimming.
