From the provided decompiled code snippet, we can infer the purpose of the function and the meaning of the variables within it. The function `_string_from_double` appears to convert a double-precision floating-point number (though passed as `undefined8`, commonly used for generic 64-bit data) to a string representation and then create a string object or similar from it. Here's a mapping of the placeholder names to more descriptive names and types:

```json
{
  "param_1": "double_value",
  "uVar1": "string_object",
  "local_38": "formatted_string_buffer",
  "local_10": "stack_check_guard_copy"
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **`param_1`:**
   - **Inferred Name:** `double_value`
   - **Type:** `double` (wrapped in `undefined8` for generic 64-bit handling)
   - **Reasoning:** This parameter is likely the double value to be converted into a string, as indicated by the formatting string `"%f"` used in the `___snprintf_chk` function.

2. **`uVar1`:**
   - **Inferred Name:** `string_object`
   - **Type:** `undefined8` (likely some form of pointer or handle to a string object)
   - **Reasoning:** This variable is used to store the result of `_string_create`, which suggests that it holds a string object or a handle/reference to such an object created from `formatted_string_buffer`.

3. **`local_38`:**
   - **Inferred Name:** `formatted_string_buffer`
   - **Type:** `char[40]` (array of 40 characters)
   - **Reasoning:** This local variable is used as a buffer to store the string output of formatting `double_value` using `___snprintf_chk`. The size `0x20` (32 in decimal) hints at it being a sufficiently sized buffer for the formatted double, although declared as 40 bytes.

4. **`local_10`:**
   - **Inferred Name:** `stack_check_guard_copy`
   - **Type:** `long`
   - **Reasoning:** This variable is used in conjunction with `PTR____stack_chk_guard_10000a030` for stack smashing protection. It stores a copy of a stack check guard value at the function's entry and checks it before returning. If the value has changed, it indicates a stack buffer overflow or similar attack, triggering `___stack_chk_fail` to prevent exploitation.

This mapping and these names provide a clearer understanding of the function's purpose and the role of each variable within it.
