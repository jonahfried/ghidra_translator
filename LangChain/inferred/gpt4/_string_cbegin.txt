Based on the provided function `_string_cbegin`, we can analyze the purpose of each component and assign meaningful names to the variables. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Function Name and Parameters**:
   - `_string_cbegin(long *param_1)`: The function name suggests it might be related to obtaining the "beginning" of a string, similar to functions like `cbegin` which typically return a const iterator to the beginning of a container in C++. The parameter `param_1` seems to be a pointer, likely pointing to a string or a similar structure.

2. **Local Variables**:
   - `long local_10;`: This local variable is used to store the result which will be returned. It seems to hold the starting address or a similar significant value of the string structure pointed to by `param_1`.

3. **Condition Checks and Logic**:
   - The function checks if `param_1` is `NULL` or if it points to a value that is `0`. This check likely ensures that the function is not operating on an uninitialized or empty string-like structure.
   - The error message printed suggests handling an error related to invalid or uninitialized input specifically for a string operation.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - The function uses `_fprintf` to log to `stderr` indicating an error situation. This further supports the fact that `param_1` should point to a valid memory structure (like a string), and an error message is printed if it doesn’t.

5. **Return Value**:
   - `local_10` is returned, which, based on the conditions, either holds the start of the string or remains `0` if an error condition is met.

Based on these observations, here is the mapping of placeholder names to inferred names and types in the format you requested:

```json
{
  "param_1" : "string_ptr",
  "local_10" : "begin_address"
}
```

### Reasoning Behind Names:
- **`param_1`**: Renamed to `string_ptr` to indicate that this is a pointer to a string or string-like data structure.
- **`local_10`**: Renamed to `begin_address`, reflecting its usage as storing the address indicating the start (or beginning) of the string, or `0` in error cases.

This renaming provides clarity regarding what each variable represents, enhancing the readability and maintainability of the code.
