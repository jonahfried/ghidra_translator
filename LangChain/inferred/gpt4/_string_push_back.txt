- `param_1`: Renamed to `string_ptr` as it seems to be a pointer to a string object.
- `param_2`: Renamed to `new_char` to indicate it's a new character being pushed to the string.
- `lVar1`: Renamed to `current_capacity` as it appears to store the current capacity of the string.
- `lVar2`: Renamed to `new_capacity` as it seems to store the new capacity after reallocation.
