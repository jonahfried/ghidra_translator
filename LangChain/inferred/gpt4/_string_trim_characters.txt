- `param_1`: Renamed to `string_ptr` since it seems to be a pointer to a string.
- `param_2`: Renamed to `characters_to_trim` to indicate that it contains the characters that need to be trimmed from the string.
- `pcVar1`: Renamed to `found_char_ptr` to indicate that it holds a pointer to a found character.
- `bVar2`: Renamed to `is_char_found` to indicate that it is a boolean flag indicating whether a character is found or not.
- `local_28`: Renamed to `end_ptr` as it seems to be pointing to the end of a range.
- `local_20`: Renamed to `start_ptr` as it seems to be pointing to the start of a range.
