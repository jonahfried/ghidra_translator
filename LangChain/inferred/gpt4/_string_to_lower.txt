Based on the provided decompiled code, we can infer the purpose of each variable and suggest more descriptive names. Here's an explanation of each inferred name and type:

1. **param_1**: This parameter appears to be a pointer to a structure or array containing a string and its length. The first element (`*param_1`) is likely the pointer to the string itself, and the second element (`param_1[1]`) seems to represent the length of the string.
   - **Inferred Name**: `string_info`
   - **Inferred Type**: `long*`

2. **iVar1**: It's used to store the return values from calls to `_isalpha` and `_tolower`, which indicates it's used to store boolean or character values temporarily.
   - **Inferred Name**: `alpha_check` when used with `_isalpha` and `lower_char` when used with `_tolower`
   - **Inferred Type**: `int`

3. **local_28**: This variable serves as an index in a loop that iterates over each character of the string. It's incremented in each iteration and used to access specific characters in the string.
   - **Inferred Name**: `char_index`
   - **Inferred Type**: `ulong`

4. **local_10**: This variable holds a pointer to a newly allocated space (likely for a string). It's assigned a value from `_malloc`, indicating it's used to store the lowercase version of the input string.
   - **Inferred Name**: `lowercase_string`
   - **Inferred Type**: `void*`

Putting it all together, the mapping of placeholder names to inferred names and types is:

```json
{
  "param_1": "string_info",
  "iVar1": "alpha_check_or_lower_char",
  "local_28": "char_index",
  "local_10": "lowercase_string"
}
```

Reasoning:
- `param_1` is inferred as `string_info` because it apparently contains details about the string (pointer and length).
- `iVar1` is used both as a boolean check and a temporary storage for character conversion, hence `alpha_check_or_lower_char`.
- `local_28` clearly functions as an index for character iteration, thus `char_index`.
- `local_10` is used to store the result of the string conversion and is allocated memory, therefore named `lowercase_string`.
