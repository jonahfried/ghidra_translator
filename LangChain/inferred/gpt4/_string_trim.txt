From the provided code snippet, we can infer the purpose of each variable and their respective types based on the function's usage and behavior. Here's a detailed analysis:

1. **param_1**: 
   - **Usage**: This variable is passed as an argument to `_string_trim`, and subsequently to `_string_trim_left` and `_string_trim_right`.
   - **Type**: It is of type `long`, which is likely used here as a pointer (a common practice in C/C++ for pointer manipulation with integer types).
   - **Inferred Name**: Since the function is related to modifying a string by trimming spaces (as indicated by the function names `_string_trim_left` and `_string_trim_right`), `param_1` is likely a pointer to the string object or structure being manipulated. A fitting name could be `string_ptr`.
   
2. **PTR____stderrp_10000a038**:
   - **Usage**: This variable holds a pointer to `FILE **` which refers to the standard error stream (`stderr`). This is used in the context of printing an error message, implying it's a pointer to `stderr`.
   - **Type**: The type is `FILE **`, indicating it is a pointer to a pointer of `FILE` type, standard for handling file streams in C.
   - **Inferred Name**: Since it's clearly used to access `stderr`, a descriptive name would be `ptr_stderr`.

3. **_fprintf**:
   - **Usage**: This function is a standard C function used for formatted output to streams.
   - **Type**: Function pointer type.
   - **Inferred Name**: `_fprintf` is already a descriptive name since it follows the standard naming of C standard library functions, possibly indicating a custom or wrapped version of `fprintf`.

4. **"Error: Null String object in string_trim.\n"**:
   - **Usage**: This is a constant string used for error messaging.
   - **Type**: It's a string literal.
   - **Inferred Name**: Since this is a literal and not a variable, it doesnâ€™t need a name change.

Here's the mapping in the required format:

```json
{
  "param_1": "string_ptr",
  "PTR____stderrp_10000a038": "ptr_stderr"
}
```

This mapping provides a clearer understanding of what each variable represents in the context of the function `_string_trim`, making the code more readable and maintainable.
