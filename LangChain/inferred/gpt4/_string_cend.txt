From the provided decompiled function `_string_cend`, we can infer a more meaningful description for each variable and parameter by examining their usage patterns and the function's overall behavior. Here is an analysis:

1. **Function Name and Parameters:**
   - The function is named `_string_cend`, which might suggest it's related to finding the "end" of something in a string context, possibly calculating the end position of a string or structure involving string manipulation.
   - `param_1`: This parameter is used as a pointer and is checked against `NULL`, and its dereferenced value is also checked. Given it's used in pointer arithmetic (`*param_1 + param_1[1]`), `param_1` likely points to a structure or array related to string data, potentially holding a base address and a length.

2. **Local Variables:**
   - `local_10`: This variable holds the result calculated based on the conditions checked in the function. It appears to be the computed "end" position or address, thus it can be inferred as `result` or `end_position`. The type is `long`, which often represents addresses or integer calculations on 64-bit systems.
   
3. **Internal Logic and Computations:**
   - The function first checks if `param_1` is `NULL` or if the dereferenced value at `param_1` is `0`. This suggests a safeguard against using uninitialized or invalid data.
   - The error message printed implies that `param_1` should be an initialized and valid reference to string-related data.
   - Calculation `*param_1 + param_1[1]` suggests that possibly `*param_1` could be the start address or base of a string, and `param_1[1]` might be its length or offset to reach the end.

4. **Error Handling:**
   - The function writes to `stderr` via `_fprintf` when encountering a `NULL` or a zeroed-out value at `param_1`. This is typical error handling for invalid input parameters.

Given this analysis, the placeholder to descriptive name mappings for the variables and types can be summarized as:

```json
{
  "param_1": "string_data",
  "local_10": "end_position"
}
```

**Explanations:**
- `param_1` is renamed to `string_data` as it is used to reference data related to a string, likely containing address and length based on the arithmetic used.
- `local_10` is renamed to `end_position` because it holds the computed end position of the string or data structure, derived from the base and offset (or length).
