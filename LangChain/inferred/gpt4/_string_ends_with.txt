From the provided Ghidra decompiled code, we can infer the purpose and nature of the variables based on their usage within the function `_string_ends_with`. The function aims to check if the string represented by `param_1` ends with the substring `param_2`. Below is the mapping for the placeholder names to more descriptive, concise names based on their roles and data types:

```json
{
  "param_1": "string_object_ptr",
  "param_2": "substring",
  "iVar1": "comparison_result",
  "sVar2": "substring_length",
  "local_9": "ends_with_substring"
}
```

**Explanation of inferred names:**

1. **`param_1`**: Named as `string_object_ptr`:
   - This parameter is a pointer to a long, which from context seems to be a pointer to a structure or complex data type representing a string (likely a custom string object). The function checks if this pointer itself is NULL and also dereferences it to check the content, indicating it might point to a dynamically allocated structure or array.

2. **`param_2`**: Named as `substring`:
   - This is a straightforward char pointer used directly in string-related functions (`_strlen`, `_strncmp`), indicating it is a regular C-style string.

3. **`iVar1`**: Named as `comparison_result`:
   - This integer variable is used to store the result of `_strncmp`, which compares two strings. Hence, the name `comparison_result` reflects its purpose.

4. **`sVar2`**: Named as `substring_length`:
   - This variable is assigned the result of `_strlen(param_2)`, which returns the length of the substring. Thus, `substring_length` is an apt descriptive name.

5. **`local_9`**: Named as `ends_with_substring`:
   - This boolean variable ultimately holds the value returned by the function, which indicates whether the `string_object_ptr`'s string ends with `substring`. The name `ends_with_substring` directly reflects this role.

With these names, the function and its operations become much clearer to any developer or code maintainer reading the code.
