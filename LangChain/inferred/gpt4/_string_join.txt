The function `_string_join` appears to concatenate elements of a string array, using a given delimiter. Here's the detailed breakdown and renaming of the variables and parameters based on their usage in the function:

1. **param_1**: This is the first parameter to the function. It's used as the base pointer for accessing an array of strings. Given that it is checked against `0` (interpreted as `NULL`), it is likely a pointer to an array of strings. The type is `long`, but it's probably meant to represent a pointer, so it should be named something like `string_array_ptr`.

2. **param_2**: This is the second parameter, used to determine the number of strings to join. It is checked to ensure it is at least `1`, suggesting it represents the count of the strings in the array. It should be named something like `string_count`.

3. **param_3**: This is used as the delimiter for joining the strings. It's also checked against `0` (or `NULL`), confirming it's a pointer to a delimiter string. So, it should be named `delimiter_ptr`.

4. **local_34**: This local variable is used as an index in the loop that iterates over the string array. Naming it `index` would be appropriate.

5. **local_10**: This local variable is used to store the result of the string creation and then is used in appending operations. It seems to act as a buffer or a result string. It should be named `result_str_ptr`.

Here's the mapping in the requested format:

```json
{
  "param_1": "string_array_ptr",
  "param_2": "string_count",
  "param_3": "delimiter_ptr",
  "local_34": "index",
  "local_10": "result_str_ptr"
}
```

These names provide a clearer understanding of what each variable is used for within the function:
- `string_array_ptr` points to the start of the array of string pointers.
- `string_count` tells how many strings are there to join.
- `delimiter_ptr` points to the string used as a delimiter between each string in the array.
- `index` is used to loop through the array.
- `result_str_ptr` holds the final concatenated string result.
