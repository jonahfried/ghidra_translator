## Mapping of Placeholder Variable Names to Descriptive Names

Here's the mapping of placeholder variable names to descriptive names along with explanations:

```
{
  "param_1": "string_object", // Represents a pointer to a String object
  "param_2": "substring", // Represents a pointer to the substring to check
  "local_9": "result", // Represents the boolean result of the function
  "sVar2": "substring_length", // Represents the length of the substring
  "iVar1": "comparison_result", // Represents the result of comparing the substring with the end of the string
}
```

## Explanation of Inferred Names

* **string_object**: This name clearly indicates that `param_1` points to a String object, which is consistent with its usage in the code.
* **substring**: This name directly reflects the purpose of `param_2`, which is to hold the substring to be checked against the end of the string.
* **result**: This name summarizes the function's output, which is a boolean indicating whether the string ends with the substring.
* **substring_length**: This name describes the value stored in `sVar2`, which is the length of the substring.
* **comparison_result**: This name clarifies the purpose of `iVar1`, which is to store the outcome of comparing the substring with the end of the string. 

## Reasoning Behind the Mapping

The inferred names are chosen to be:

* **Descriptive**: They clearly convey the purpose and meaning of each variable.
* **Concise**: They are short and to the point, avoiding unnecessary verbosity.
* **Consistent**: They use consistent naming conventions (snake_case) for better readability. 
* **Contextual**: They take into account the context of the code and the surrounding variables. 

By using these descriptive names, the code becomes more readable and easier to understand.
