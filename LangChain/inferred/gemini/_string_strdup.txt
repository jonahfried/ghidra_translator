## Mapping Placeholder Names to Descriptive Names

Here's the mapping of placeholder names to descriptive names and types along with the reasoning:

```
{
  'param_1': 'string_to_duplicate', // The string to be duplicated.
  'sVar1': 'string_length', // Length of the string to be duplicated.
  'local_10': 'duplicated_string', // The duplicated string.
}
```

### Reasoning

* `param_1`: This is the first parameter to the function and is used to store the string that needs to be duplicated. Therefore, it's named `string_to_duplicate`.
* `sVar1`: This variable holds the length of the string obtained using `_strlen`. Since it represents the length of the string, it's named `string_length`.
* `local_10`: This variable stores the pointer to the newly allocated memory for the duplicated string. It's named `duplicated_string` to reflect its purpose.

## Additional Notes

* The function checks for a null pointer for the input string and handles it by printing an error message and returning a null pointer.
* In case of successful memory allocation, the function uses `_strcpy_chk` to copy the original string to the newly allocated memory, ensuring null termination.
* The function name `_string_strdup` suggests its purpose â€“ to duplicate a string. The underscore prefix might indicate that it's an internal or private function.
