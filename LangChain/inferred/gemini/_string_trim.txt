## Mapping of Placeholder Names to Descriptive Names:

```
{
  "param_1": "string_object",
}
```

## Reasoning:

* **param_1**: Based on its usage within the code, `param_1` represents a pointer to a string object. It is passed to both `_string_trim_left` and `_string_trim_right` functions, which suggests it is the string being trimmed. Additionally, the error message mentions a "Null String object", further confirming this interpretation. Therefore, it is named `string_object`.

## Additional Notes:

* The code snippet only shows the function `_string_trim`, without the implementations of `_string_trim_left` and `_string_trim_right`. Analyzing those functions would likely provide more context and potentially lead to additional name refinements.
* The placeholder names `PTR____stderrp_10000a038` and `_fprintf` are likely related to standard error output functionalities. However, without further information about their specific roles, it is difficult to provide more descriptive names.
