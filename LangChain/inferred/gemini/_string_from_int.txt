## Inferred Variable Names and Types

Here's a mapping of placeholder names to descriptive names and types based on the provided decompiled code:

```
{
  "param_1": "number", // First argument to the function, likely an integer
  "local_1c": "buffer", // Local variable used as a buffer for sprintf
  "local_10": "stack_guard", // Local variable used to store the stack guard value
  "uVar1": "string", // Return value of the function, a string representation of the number
}
```

## Reasoning

Here's the reasoning behind each inferred name:

* **param_1**: This is the first argument to the function and is likely an integer based on its use in the `sprintf` format string. Since it represents a number, we named it `number`.
* **local_1c**: This local variable is used as a buffer for the `sprintf` function, which formats the number into a string. We named it `buffer` to reflect its purpose.
* **local_10**: This local variable stores the value of the stack guard. We named it `stack_guard` to indicate its role in protecting against stack overflows.
* **uVar1**: This is the return value of the function and is a string representation of the number passed as the argument. We named it `string` to reflect its data type.

## Additional Notes

* The code appears to be a simple function that takes an integer as input and returns its string representation.
* The use of `___sprintf_chk` and `___stack_chk_fail` suggests that the code is compiled with security checks enabled.
* The function does not handle errors, such as insufficient memory for string creation.
