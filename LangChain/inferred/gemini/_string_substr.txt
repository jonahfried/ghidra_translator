## Mapping of Placeholder Names to Descriptive Names

Here's a mapping of placeholder names to descriptive names for the provided code, along with explanations:

```
{
  'param_1': 'string_object',  # Represents the pointer to the String object.
  'param_2': 'start_index', # Represents the starting index of the substring.
  'param_3': 'max_length', # Represents the maximum length of the substring.
  'local_28': 'substring_length', # Represents the actual length of the substring.
  'local_10': 'substring_object', # Represents the pointer to the newly created substring object.
  'pvVar1': 'substring_data', # Represents the pointer to the data buffer of the substring object.
}
```

## Explanation of Name Choices

* **`param_1`**: This parameter points to the original String object. We can infer that it's an object because it's used with array indexing (`param_1[1]`) to access its properties. We choose the name `string_object` for clarity.
* **`param_2`**: This parameter represents the starting index of the substring. We choose the name `start_index` as it directly describes its purpose.
* **`param_3`**: This parameter represents the maximum length of the substring. We choose the name `max_length` to reflect its meaning.
* **`local_28`**: This variable is used to calculate the actual length of the substring, taking the minimum of `max_length` and the available characters after `start_index` in the original string. We choose the name `substring_length` to reflect its purpose.
* **`local_10`**: This variable stores the pointer to the newly created substring object. We choose the name `substring_object` for clarity.
* **`pvVar1`**: This variable points to the data buffer of the substring object. We choose the name `substring_data` to describe its content.

These names are chosen to be descriptive, concise, and follow snake_case convention. They make the code easier to understand and maintain.
