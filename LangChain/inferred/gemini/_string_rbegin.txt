## Variable Name Mapping and Reasoning

Here's the mapping of placeholder names to descriptive names with explanations:

```
{
  "param_1": "string_ptr", // Pointer to the string
  "local_10": "string_end_index", // Index of the last character in the string
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **`param_1`**: This variable is a pointer to the string. Since the function operates on strings, naming it `string_ptr` clearly indicates its purpose. 
* **`local_10`**: This variable stores the index of the last character in the string. The calculation `*param_1 + param_1[1] + -1` suggests it adds the length of the string (`param_1[1]`) to the address of the first character (`*param_1`) and then subtracts 1 to account for zero-based indexing. Hence, the name `string_end_index` accurately reflects its meaning. 

## Additional Notes

* The code snippet appears to implement a function named `_string_rbegin`. 
* The function checks if the provided string pointer is valid and not empty. If not, it prints an error message and returns 0.
* If the string is valid, the function calculates the index of the last character and returns it.
