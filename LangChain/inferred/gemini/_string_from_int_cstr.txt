## Placeholder Variable Mapping:

Here's the mapping from placeholder variable names to descriptive names and types, along with the reasoning behind each inferred name:

```
{
  "param_1" : "integer_value", // Represents the integer value passed as an argument.
  "local_1c" : "formatted_string", // Local buffer to hold the formatted string.
  "local_10" : "stack_guard_value", // Stores the stack canary value for later verification.
  "sVar1" : "string_length", // Length of the formatted string.
  "pvVar2" : "allocated_memory", // Pointer to the allocated memory for the string.
}
```

## Reasoning for Inferred Names:

* **integer_value**: The variable `param_1` is the first argument to the function and is used to hold an integer value.
* **formatted_string**: The variable `local_1c` is a local buffer that stores the formatted string representation of the integer value using `sprintf`.
* **string_length**: The variable `sVar1` stores the length of the formatted string obtained using `_strlen`.
* **stack_guard_value**: The variable `local_10` is assigned the value of the stack canary, which is used for detecting stack smashing attacks.
* **allocated_memory**: The variable `pvVar2` points to the memory allocated using `_malloc` to store the formatted string. 

## Additional Notes:

* The function first retrieves the stack canary value and stores it in `local_10`.
* It then uses `sprintf` to format the integer argument (`param_1`) into a string and store it in the `local_1c` buffer.
* The length of the formatted string is calculated using `_strlen` and stored in `sVar1`.
* Memory is allocated using `_malloc` to store the string, and the pointer to the allocated memory is stored in `pvVar2`.
* The function copies the formatted string from `local_1c` to the allocated memory using `strcpy`.
* Before returning, the function checks if the stack canary value remains unchanged. If it has been modified, indicating a potential stack smashing attack, the function calls `___stack_chk_fail` to terminate the program.
