## Mapping from placeholder names to descriptive names:

```
{
  local_10: string_length,
}
```

## Reasoning:

* **local_10**: This is the local variable within the `_string_length` function. Based on its usage, it appears to store the length of a string. Therefore, we name it `string_length`. 
* **param_1**: This is the function parameter. Since the function seems to be related to string length, and the parameter is used to access the string object, we can infer that it represents the address of the string object. We can name it `string_object_address`.
* **PTR____stderrp_10000a038**: This appears to be a global variable pointer pointing to the standard error output stream (`stderr`). We can leave it as is or use a more descriptive name like `stderr_stream`.

It's important to note that without additional context or information about the surrounding code, these names are based on reasonable assumptions and might need adjustments depending on the specific context.
