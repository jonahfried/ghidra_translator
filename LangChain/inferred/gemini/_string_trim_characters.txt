## Mapping Placeholder Names to Descriptive Names and Types

Here's the mapping of placeholder names to descriptive names and types:

```
{
  "param_1": "string_object", // Points to a String object
  "param_2": "chars_to_trim", // Array of characters to trim
  "local_20": "string_data_start", // Pointer to the start of the string data
  "local_28": "string_data_end", // Pointer to the end of the string data (exclusive)
  "pcVar1": "char_match", // Pointer to a matched character in chars_to_trim
}
```

## Reasoning for Inferred Names

* **string_object**: The first parameter `param_1` is a pointer to a `String` object, based on the checks for null pointers and the use of `param_1[1]` to access the length of the string data.
* **chars_to_trim**: The second parameter `param_2` is an array of characters to be trimmed, based on the checks for null pointers and the use of `_strchr` to search for characters within this array.
* **string_data_start**: The variable `local_20` is initialized with the address of the string data, which is extracted from the `String` object.
* **string_data_end**: The variable `local_28` is initially set to the address one character beyond the end of the string data. It is then adjusted by searching for characters to trim from the end of the string.
* **char_match**: The variable `pcVar1` is used to store the result of `_strchr`, which returns a pointer to the first occurrence of a character in the `chars_to_trim` array within the string data. 

## Additional Notes

* The original code uses Hungarian notation, which is not commonly used in Python. The inferred names are in snake_case to follow Python naming conventions.
* The function appears to trim characters from both the beginning and the end of a string, based on the use of two loops and the adjustment of `string_data_end`.
