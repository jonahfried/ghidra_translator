We can construct the following mapping from the placeholder variable names to descriptive, concise names (in snake case):

```
{
  "param_1": "string_array",
  "param_2": "count",
  "param_3": "delimiter",
  "local_34": "index",
  "local_10": "joined_string",
}
```

## Reasoning for each inferred name:

* **param_1**: This variable is used as the array of strings to be joined. Therefore, "string_array" is a descriptive name.
* **param_2**: This variable represents the number of strings in the array. "count" accurately reflects its purpose.
* **param_3**: This variable holds the delimiter character that separates the joined strings. Hence, "delimiter" is an appropriate name.
* **local_34**: This variable acts as a loop counter to iterate through the string array. "index" clearly indicates its usage.
* **local_10**: This variable stores the resulting string after joining all the elements. "joined_string" aptly describes its meaning.

## Additional Notes:

* The variable names are all in snake case, which is the standard naming convention for Python variables.
* The inferred names accurately reflect the purpose of each variable in the context of the code.
* This mapping helps improve the readability and maintainability of the decompiled code.
