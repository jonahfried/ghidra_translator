## Mapping of Placeholder Names to Descriptive Names

Here's the mapping of placeholder names to descriptive names along with explanations:

```
{
  "param_1": "input_string", // Represents the input string to the function
  "local_10": "result_string", // Represents the resulting string from the function
  "PTR____stderrp_10000a038": "stderr", // Represents the standard error output stream
}
```

## Explanation of Name Inferences

* **`param_1`**: This variable is the first parameter to the function and holds the input string. It is inferred as `input_string` for clarity.
* **`local_10`**: This variable is declared locally within the function and holds the result string. It is inferred as `result_string` to indicate its purpose.
* **`PTR____stderrp_10000a038`**: This variable is a pointer to the standard error output stream. It is inferred as `stderr` for conciseness and consistency with common naming conventions.

## Reasoning for Inferred Types

While the code snippet doesn't explicitly specify variable types, we can infer them based on context:

* **`param_1`**: Since it is passed as an argument to the function, it is likely a pointer to a character array (i.e., a string).
* **`local_10`**: Similarly, it is also a pointer to a character array, storing the resulting string.
* **`PTR____stderrp_10000a038`**: Based on its name, it can be inferred as a pointer to a `FILE` object, specifically the standard error stream.

## Additional Notes

* The inferred names are in snake_case for consistency with common Python naming conventions.
* The mapping only includes the placeholder names present in the provided code snippet.
* Further analysis of the surrounding code or additional information about the function's purpose might lead to more specific or accurate inferences.
