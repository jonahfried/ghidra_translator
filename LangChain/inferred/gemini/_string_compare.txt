## Placeholder Variable Mapping

Here's a mapping from placeholder variable names to descriptive names along with explanations:

```
{
  "param_1": "string1",   # First string to compare
  "param_2": "string2",   # Second string to compare
  "local_c": "comparison_result",  # Result of the string comparison (-1, 0, or 1)
}
```

### Reasoning for Inferred Names

* **param_1**: We know this is a pointer to a character array, representing a string. We inferred `string1` because it's the first string argument to the function.
* **param_2**: Similar to `param_1`, this is also a pointer to a character array, representing a string. We inferred `string2` as it's the second string argument.
* **local_c**: This variable stores the result of the string comparison. We inferred `comparison_result` as it accurately reflects the purpose of the variable.

## Further Context-Based Inferences

Although not provided in the code snippet, further information about the function might lead to more specific names:

* **Function name**: If the function name was `compare_string_lengths`, `string1_length` and `string2_length` would be more descriptive than simply `string1` and `string2`.
* **Error messages**: If the error message mentioned "comparing string contents", names like `string1_contents` and `string2_contents` could be relevant.

In essence, the context provided by the surrounding code and function purpose can be crucial in assigning the most informative names.
