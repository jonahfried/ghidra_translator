## Mapping and Reasoning:

```
{
  "param_1": "string_ptr",
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* `param_1` is a pointer to a long, which is likely the beginning of a string in memory. 
* The function `_string_crbegin` operates on strings, so it makes sense to name the pointer `string_ptr` for clarity.
* The function checks if the pointer is null or points to an empty string. This further suggests that it's dealing with a string.
* The function returns the length of the string, which is calculated by adding the first two elements pointed to by the pointer and subtracting 1. This aligns with how C strings are stored in memory, where the first element is the string length and the subsequent elements are the characters.

**Note:**

* The placeholder name `local_10` is not included in the mapping, as it is a local variable within the function and not relevant to the overall understanding of the code.
