## Mapping and Reasoning:

```
{
  "param_1": "left_operand", // First operand of the string comparison
  "param_2": "right_operand"  // Second operand of the string comparison
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* `param_1` and `param_2` are generic placeholder names that don't provide any context about their purpose. 
* By analyzing the function's behavior, we can infer that they represent the two operands being compared for equality. 
* `left_operand` and `right_operand` clearly indicate their roles in the comparison, enhancing code readability and understanding. 

## Additional Notes:

* The function `_string_compare` is likely responsible for comparing two strings, although its detailed implementation isn't provided.
* The return value indicates whether the strings are equal (`true` for equal, `false` for not equal).
