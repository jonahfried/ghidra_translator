## Mapping placeholder names to descriptive names:

```
{
  "param_1": "input_wide_string",
  "sVar1": "wide_string_length",
  "pcVar2": "utf8_string",
  "local_10": "result_string",
}
```

## Reasoning behind each inferred name:

* `param_1`: This is the first parameter of the function and it represents the input wide string. Therefore, it is named `input_wide_string`.
* `sVar1`: This variable stores the length of the wide string after conversion. Hence, it is named `wide_string_length`.
* `pcVar2`: This variable points to the allocated memory for the UTF-8 string. Thus, it is named `utf8_string`.
* `local_10`: This variable holds the final result string obtained after conversion. Therefore, it is named `result_string`.

## Additional notes:

* The names are chosen to be descriptive and concise, following snake_case convention.
* The context of the code is considered when inferring the names. For example, the function converts a wide string to a UTF-8 string, which is reflected in the names. 
* The function also handles potential errors during conversion and memory allocation, which is not explicitly reflected in the inferred names. However, it is important to keep these error handling aspects in mind when interpreting the code.
