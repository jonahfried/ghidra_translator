## Descriptive Naming for `_string_reverse` Function

Here's a mapping of placeholder names to descriptive names along with explanations:

```
{
  "param_1": "string_object", // Represents the pointer to the string object
  "pvVar1": "reversed_string", // Represents the allocated memory for the reversed string
  "local_20": "current_index", // Represents the current index during string reversal
  "local_1c": "original_length", // Represents the original length of the string
}
```

### Explanations:

* `param_1`: This placeholder represents a pointer to the string object. We name it `string_object` as it clearly indicates its purpose within the function. 
* `pvVar1`: This placeholder is a pointer to the allocated memory for the reversed string. We name it `reversed_string` to reflect its content and purpose.
* `local_20`: This variable tracks the current index during the string reversal process. `current_index` accurately describes its role. 
* `local_1c`: This variable stores the original length of the string. Naming it `original_length` enhances readability and clarifies its usage. 

## Reasoning: 

These names are chosen based on their context and usage within the code. They are descriptive, concise, and follow snake_case convention for improved readability and understanding.
