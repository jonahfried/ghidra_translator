## Mapping from Placeholder to Descriptive Names:

Here's a mapping of the placeholder names to descriptive names, along with explanations:

**Original Name** | **Descriptive Name** | **Type** | **Reasoning**
---|---|---|---
local_10 | current_string | char* | This variable stores the current string being processed.
param_1 | string_ptr | char** | This parameter points to a character pointer, which is the beginning of the string.

## Reasoning for Descriptive Names:

* **current_string:** This name better reflects the variable's purpose of holding the current string being processed within the function.
* **string_ptr:** This name clarifies that the parameter is a pointer to the beginning of a string, making its usage more understandable.

## Additional Notes:

* The function appears to handle cases where the input string pointer is null or points to an empty string.
* The `_fprintf` calls suggest logging error messages in such scenarios.
* The function returns the `current_string` after checking for valid input.
