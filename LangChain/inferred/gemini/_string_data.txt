## Mapping of Placeholder Variable Names to Descriptive Names

Here's a mapping of placeholder variable names to descriptive names along with explanations:

```
{
  "_string_data": "get_string_data",
  "param_1": "input_string_pointer",
  "local_10": "string_data",
}
```

### Explanations

* **"_string_data"**: This function clearly retrieves string data, so we renamed it to "get_string_data" for clarity.
* **"param_1"**: This parameter is a pointer to a long integer, which is likely the address of the string data. We renamed it to "input_string_pointer" to indicate its purpose and type.
* **"local_10"**: This variable stores the actual string data, so we renamed it to "string_data" for clarity.

## Reasoning

The code checks if the "input_string_pointer" is valid and non-null. If not, it prints an error message and sets "string_data" to 0. Otherwise, it assigns the value pointed to by "input_string_pointer" to "string_data". 

This suggests that the function's purpose is to retrieve string data, which is reflected in the chosen names. 

## Additional Notes

* The names are chosen to be descriptive, concise, and in snake_case format as requested.
* If you have additional information about the context of this code, such as the surrounding code or the purpose of the program, it may be possible to further refine the names and explanations.
