## Inferred Variable Names

```
{
  "param_1": "string_ptr",
  "param_2": "position",
  "param_3": "erase_length",
  "local_20": "adjusted_erase_length",
}
```

## Reasoning

Here's the reasoning behind each inferred name:

* **param_1**: This variable points to a long, which based on the function name and its usage, we can infer is a pointer to the string object being modified. Hence, we name it `string_ptr`.
* **param_2**: This variable represents an unsigned long, which is used as an index into the string. We interpret it as the position where the erase operation should start and name it `position`.
* **param_3**: This variable holds a long integer and represents the intended length of the erase operation. We name it `erase_length`.
* **local_20**: This variable is used to store an adjusted erase length, taking into account the boundaries of the string. We name it `adjusted_erase_length` to reflect its purpose. 

## Explanation

The function `_string_erase` takes three arguments:

* `string_ptr`: Pointer to the string object being modified.
* `position`: Index within the string where the erase operation should start.
* `erase_length`: Length of the string segment to be erased.

The function first checks if the string pointer is NULL and prints an error message if it is. Then, it verifies if the `position` is within the bounds of the string. If so, it calculates an adjusted erase length (`adjusted_erase_length`) to ensure it doesn't erase beyond the string's end. Finally, it uses the `___memmove_chk` function to shift the remaining string characters to fill the gap created by the erase operation and updates the string's length accordingly. If the `position` is out of bounds, the function prints an error message.
