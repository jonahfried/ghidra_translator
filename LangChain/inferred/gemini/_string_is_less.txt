## Inferred Variable Names and Reasoning

Based on your provided code, here's a mapping from placeholder names to descriptive, snake_case names along with explanations:

```
{
  "param_1": "input_string_1", 
  "param_2": "input_string_2",
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **param_1** and **param_2**: Both are input parameters to the `_string_is_less` function, likely representing two strings to be compared. The names are changed to `input_string_1` and `input_string_2` for clarity and to indicate their role as input data.

## Additional Notes

* The code snippet only shows the function definition without the implementation. Analyzing the function body could provide further context and potentially lead to more specific and descriptive variable names.
* Since the code appears to be related to string comparisons, the inferred names reflect that assumption. However, if the code is used in a different context, the names might need to be adjusted accordingly.

## Conclusion

By analyzing the provided code and considering its purpose, we were able to infer descriptive and concise snake_case names for the placeholder variables, improving code readability and understanding.
