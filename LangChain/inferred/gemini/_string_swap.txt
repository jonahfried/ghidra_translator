## Mapping of placeholder names to descriptive names and types:

```
{
  "param_1": "string1", 
  "param_2": "string2", 
  "uVar1": "string1_data", 
  "uVar2": "string1_next", 
  "uVar3": "string1_prev", 
  "uVar4": "string1_len", 
}
```

## Reasoning behind the inferred names:

* **param_1** and **param_2**: These are the function parameters and represent two string objects. We use descriptive names `string1` and `string2` to clearly identify their purpose.
* **uVar1**, **uVar2**, **uVar3**, **uVar4**: These are local variables that are used to hold the values of `string1`'s fields before they are swapped with `string2`. The "uVar" prefix suggests they were originally unnamed variables. 
* Based on their usage in the code, we infer that they represent the following fields:
    * `string1_data`: Stores the actual string data.
    * `string1_next`: Pointer to the next string in a linked list (if applicable).
    * `string1_prev`: Pointer to the previous string in a linked list (if applicable).
    * `string1_len`: Length of the string.

## Additional notes:

* The function appears to perform a simple swap of the contents of two string objects. 
* The error handling section checks for null pointers to the string objects and prints an error message if encountered.
