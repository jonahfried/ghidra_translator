## Mapping of Placeholder Variable Names to Descriptive Names and Types

Here's the mapping of placeholder variable names to descriptive names and types, along with explanations for each:

```python
{
    "param_1": "string_ptr",  # Pointer to the string
    "param_1[1]": "string_length", # Length of the string (potentially stored after the null terminator)
    "local_10": "string_end_index", # Index of the end of the string
}
```

### Reasoning for Each Inferred Name:

* **`param_1`**: This variable is a pointer to a memory location, and the context suggests it points to a string. Therefore, it's named `string_ptr` for clarity.
* **`param_1[1]`**: This variable accesses the element at index 1 of the memory pointed to by `param_1`. Given that the function checks if `*param_1` is 0 (null terminator) and the context of the function name (`_string_end`), it's likely that this element stores the length of the string. Hence, it's named `string_length`.
* **`local_10`**: This variable stores the calculated end index of the string. The calculation involves adding `string_length` to `string_ptr`, so the name `string_end_index` accurately reflects its purpose. 

## Additional Notes:

* The code snippet suggests potential error handling for cases where the input pointer is invalid or the string is uninitialized.
* The function appears to calculate the end index of a string, possibly considering the first element as the null terminator and the second element as the length. 
* This analysis is based on the limited context provided and may require further investigation for complete understanding.
