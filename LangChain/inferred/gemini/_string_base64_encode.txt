## Mapping placeholder to descriptive variable names

```python
{
  "_string_base64_encode": "string_base64_encode",
  "param_1": "string_to_encode",
  "local_30": "i",
  "local_28": "current_bits",
  "local_24": "current_byte",
  "local_10": "encoded_string",
  "_stderrp_10000a038": "stderr_stream",
  "_base64_chars": "base64_chars",
}
```

## Reasoning behind inferred names

1. **"_string_base64_encode": "string_base64_encode"**: 
    - The function takes a string as input and encodes it to base64. The suffix `_encode` clarifies the intended action.

2. **"param_1": "string_to_encode"**: 
    - This parameter holds the string that needs to be encoded. The inferred name provides clear context about its purpose.

3. **"local_30": "i"**: 
    - This variable iterates through the string to encode each character. The "i" is a conventional name for loop iterators.

4. **"local_28": "current_bits"**: 
    - This variable tracks how many bits of a character have been encoded. 
    - "current_bits"  expresses its role more informatively than a generic `local_28`.

5. **"local_24": "current_byte"**: 
    - This variable holds the current character being processed, translated as an integer. 
    - "current_byte" clarifies its usage compared to the cryptic `local_24`.

6. **"local_10": "encoded_string"**: 
    - This variable stores the encoded string which is the outcome of the function. 
    - The inferred name clearly reflects its intended output format.

7. **"_stderrp_10000a038": "stderr_stream"**: 
    - This refers to the standard error stream for printing errors. 
    - "stderr_stream" accurately indicates its nature compared to the cryptic placeholder.

8. **"_base64_chars": "base64_chars"**: 
    - This variable contains the character mappings used for base64 encoding. 
    - "base64_chars" clearly identifies its usage without using the ambiguous placeholder.
