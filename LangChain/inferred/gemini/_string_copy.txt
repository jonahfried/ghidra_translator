## Placeholder to Descriptive Name Mapping with Reasoning:

Here's a mapping from placeholder names to descriptive names and their reasoning based on the provided code:

```
{
  "param_1": "src_string",        # Pointer to the source string
  "param_2": "dest_buffer",       # Pointer to the destination buffer
  "param_3": "start_pos",         # Starting position in the source string
  "param_4": "copy_len",          # Length of the string to be copied
  "local_38": "actual_copy_len",   # Actual length copied (considering bounds)
  "local_10": "copied_len",        # Length of the string actually copied
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **param_1**: This is a pointer to the source string, which is where the data will be copied from.
* **param_2**: This is a pointer to the destination buffer, which is where the data will be copied to.
* **param_3**: This is the starting position in the source string from where the copy should begin.
* **param_4**: This is the length of the string to be copied.
* **local_38**: This variable is used to calculate the actual length to be copied, considering the bounds of the source string and the copy length.
* **local_10**: This variable stores the actual length of the string copied, which could be less than the requested length if the starting position or the length exceeds the bounds of the source string.

This mapping provides clear and concise names that reflect the purpose of each variable, making the code easier to understand and maintain.
