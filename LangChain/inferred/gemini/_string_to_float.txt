## Placeholder to Descriptive Name Mapping:

```
{
  "param_1": "input_string",
  "local_c": "float_value",
  "dVar2": "atof_result",
}
```

## Reasoning:

* `param_1`: This is the input to the function and represents a string pointer. We can infer its purpose is to hold the string that should be converted to a float. Hence, we rename it to `input_string`.
* `local_c`: This variable stores the final converted float value. The name `local_c` is quite generic. We can infer its purpose based on its type and usage: it's a float and assigned the final result of the conversion. Thus, we rename it to `float_value`.
* `dVar2`: This variable temporarily stores the result of the `_atof` function which converts a string to a double. Since this function is used for float conversion and the variable's type is double, we can infer this variable holds the intermediate conversion result. We rename it to `atof_result`.

## Additional Notes:

* The function seems to be responsible for converting a string to a float. It checks for empty strings and null string pointers, handling errors accordingly.
* The explanation provided assumes the context of the code and function purpose. 
* If more context about the surrounding code were available, the inferred names could potentially be more specific.


This mapping provides meaningful, descriptive names for the placeholder variables, improving code readability and understanding.
