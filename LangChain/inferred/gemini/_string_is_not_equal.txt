## Inferred Variable Names and Reasoning:

Here's the mapping of placeholder names to descriptive names and types, along with explanations:

```
{
  param_1: string_1,       // First string being compared
  param_2: string_2,       // Second string being compared
  iVar1: comparison_result, // Result of the string comparison
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* `param_1` and `param_2` are clearly string inputs to the function based on their usage in the `_string_compare` call. Naming them `string_1` and `string_2` clarifies their roles and distinguishes them.
* `iVar1` stores the result of the comparison, making `comparison_result` a more descriptive name than the generic `iVar1`. 

**Additional Notes:**

*  The code snippet only shows the function prototype and doesn't include the implementation of `_string_compare`.  Analyzing the implementation of `_string_compare` could potentially reveal further context and allow for even more descriptive names.
