## Mapping of Placeholder Names to Descriptive Names

Here's a mapping of placeholder names to descriptive names along with the reasoning behind each choice:

```
{
  "param_1": "string",    // Represents the input string
  "local_10": "str_len",  // Represents the length of the string
}
```

### Reasoning:

* **`param_1`**: 
    * The variable is used as the input to the function.
    * The function aims to calculate the length of a string.
    * Therefore, it is named "string" to reflect its purpose.
* **`local_10`**:
    * The variable stores the result of the `_strlen` function.
    * `_strlen` calculates the length of a string.
    * Hence, the variable is named "str_len" to indicate its role. 

## Explanation of Inferred Names:

* **`string`**: This name directly reflects the purpose of the variable as it holds the input string for length calculation.
* **`str_len`**: This name combines "str" for "string" and "len" for "length" to concisely describe the variable's content. 

## Additional Notes:

* The function checks for a null input string and handles it appropriately.
* The code uses `_fprintf` for error reporting, which could be replaced with a custom logging mechanism.
