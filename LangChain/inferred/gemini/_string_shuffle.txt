## Mapping of Placeholder Names to Descriptive Names

Here's the mapping of placeholder names to descriptive names and explanations for the given code:

```
{
  "param_1": "string_object",                   // Pointer to the String object
  "cVar1": "temp_char",                        // Temporary character for swapping
  "iVar2": "random_index",                      // Random index generated by _rand()
  "tVar3": "current_time",                     // Current time obtained by _time()
  "uVar4": "string_length",                   // Length of the string in the String object
  "local_20": "remaining_characters",        // Counter for remaining characters to shuffle
}
```

## Reasoning behind the inferred names:

* **param_1**: This is the first parameter to the function and represents a pointer to the `String` object. Since the function operates on a string, naming it `string_object` is more descriptive.
* **cVar1**: This variable is used temporarily within the loop to hold a character during the swapping process.  `temp_char` accurately reflects its purpose.
* **iVar2**: This variable stores a random index generated by the `_rand()` function. It is used to select a random character within the string for swapping. Hence, `random_index` is a clear and concise name.
* **tVar3**: This variable stores the current time obtained by the `_time()` function. It is used to seed the random number generator with the `_srand()` function.  `current_time` accurately reflects its purpose.
* **uVar4**: This variable stores the length of the string pointed to by `param_1`.  `string_length` directly describes its content.
* **local_20**: This variable is used as a counter within the loop, keeping track of the remaining characters to be shuffled.  `remaining_characters` clearly conveys its purpose.
