## Mapping of Placeholder Names

Here's the mapping of placeholder names to descriptive snake_case names and types, along with explanations for each:

```
{
  param_1: string1,  // First string argument for comparison
  param_2: string2,  // Second string argument for comparison
}
```

## Reasoning Behind Inferred Names

**param_1**: 
* Renamed to `string1` as it represents the first string argument for comparison within the function.
* The type is inferred as `string` based on its usage in the `_string_compare` function, which typically compares strings.

**param_2**:
* Renamed to `string2` for consistency with `string1`, indicating the second string argument.
* Type remains as `string` for the same reason as `string1`. 

## Additional Notes

* The return value of the `_string_compare` function is not used in this code snippet, so we don't infer a name for it.
* The `iVar1` variable is also not included in the mapping as it is only used internally within the function and doesn't provide additional context for understanding the function's purpose.
