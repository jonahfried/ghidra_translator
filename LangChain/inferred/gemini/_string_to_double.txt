## Inferred Variable Names and Reasoning:

```
{
  "param_1": "string_ptr",   # Pointer to the string to be converted
  "local_10": "converted_double",  # The converted double value
  "uVar1": "string_empty_result",  # Result of checking if the string is empty
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **param_1:** This variable is a pointer to a character array, which is likely the string to be converted to a double. Hence, it is named `string_ptr`.
* **local_10:** This variable stores the final converted double value. Therefore, it is named `converted_double`.
* **uVar1:** This variable is used to store the result of the `_string_empty` function call, which checks if the string is empty. So, it is named `string_empty_result`.


## Additional Notes:

* The naming convention used is snake_case, which is common for Python and other languages.
* While the code snippet focuses on the conversion to a double, the inferred names can be adapted for other data types based on the context.
* For clarity, the inferred names are more descriptive than the original placeholder names.
