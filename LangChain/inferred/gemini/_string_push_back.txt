## Placeholder variable name mapping:

```
{
  "param_1": "string_object", // Represents the object of type String
  "param_2": "character", // Represents the character to be pushed back to the string
  "lVar1": "capacity_in_bytes", // Represents the capacity of the string object in bytes
  "lVar2": "new_memory_location", // Represents the address of the newly allocated memory
}
```

## Reasoning:

* **`param_1`**: 
    * This variable points to a long array. Based on its usage, it can be inferred that this array represents a String object.
    * The usage of `_fprintf` with specific error messages about "Error: The String object is NULL" and "Error: Memory allocation failed" strengthens this inference.
    * Therefore, `param_1` is renamed to `string_object` for clarity.

* **`param_2`**:
    * This variable holds a single `undefined` value. 
    * It is used as the character to be appended to the string.
    * Therefore, it is renamed to `character` for clarity.

* **`lVar1`**:
    * This variable stores the value of `string_object[2]`.
    * `string_object[2]` is then used to calculate the `new_memory_location` size, which is double the value of `lVar1`.
    * This suggests that `lVar1` represents the capacity of the string object in terms of the number of characters it can hold.
    * Since the string operates with bytes, the capacity is converted to bytes by multiplying by 2, as each character typically occupies one byte.
    * Therefore, `lVar1` is renamed to `capacity_in_bytes`.

* **`lVar2`**:
    * This variable stores the memory address returned by the `_memory_pool_allocate` function.
    * This function is used to allocate memory, and `lVar2` stores the address of the newly allocated memory.
    * Therefore, it is renamed to `new_memory_location` for clarity.

## Additional notes:

* The code snippet exhibits typical memory management practices for dynamically resizing strings.
* Analyzing other functions and data structures within the program would further strengthen these inferred names.
