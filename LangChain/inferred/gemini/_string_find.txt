## Variable Mapping and Reasoning:

Here's the mapping of placeholder names to descriptive names along with explanations:

```
{
  "param_1": "string_object",  // Pointer to the String object
  "param_2": "substring",      // Pointer to the substring to find
  "param_3": "start_position",  // Starting position in the String object to search from
  "local_c": "found_index",    // Index of the found substring (-1 if not found)
  "pcVar1": "strstr_result",   // Result of the _strstr function call
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **`param_1`**: This variable points to a `long` array, which is the typical representation of a String object in this context. Hence, the name `string_object` is more informative.
* **`param_2`**: This variable points to a `char` array, which represents the substring to be searched for. Therefore, the name `substring` is clearer.
* **`param_3`**: This variable defines the starting position within the `string_object` to begin the search. The name `start_position` accurately reflects its purpose.
* **`local_c`**: This variable stores the result of the search: the index of the found substring or -1 if not found. Hence, the name `found_index` is more descriptive.
* **`pcVar1`**: This variable temporarily holds the result of the `_strstr` function call. The name `strstr_result` is concise and indicates its origin. 

I hope this explanation is clear and helpful!
