## Mapping from Placeholder Names to Descriptive Names and Types

Here is the mapping from placeholder names to descriptive names and types for the provided code, along with the reasoning behind each inferred name:

```
{
  "param_1": "string_object", // Pointer to the String object
  "param_2": "total_length",   // Total length of the desired padded string
  "param_3": "pad_char",       // Character used for padding
  "lVar1": "padding_length",  // Length of the padding required
  "pvVar2": "new_string_end", // Pointer to the end of the new string (after padding)
  "pvVar3": "new_string",    // Pointer to the newly allocated string with padding
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* `param_1`: This parameter points to the String object. Since it's a pointer, the name `string_object` accurately reflects its purpose.
* `param_2`: This parameter specifies the total length of the desired padded string. Hence, the name `total_length` clearly describes its function.
* `param_3`: This parameter represents the character used for padding. The name `pad_char` concisely conveys its purpose.
* `lVar1`: This local variable stores the calculated length of the padding required. The name `padding_length` directly reflects its purpose.
* `pvVar2`: This local variable points to the end of the new string after padding is applied. The name `new_string_end` clearly describes its location and function.
* `pvVar3`: This local variable points to the newly allocated string with the applied padding. The name `new_string` accurately describes its purpose and content.


## Additional Notes

* The provided code snippet appears to be related to padding a string with a specific character to a desired length.
* The function takes three parameters:
    * A pointer to the String object to be padded
    * The desired total length of the padded string
    * The character to be used for padding
* The function dynamically allocates memory for the new padded string, applies the padding, and updates the relevant fields in the String object.
