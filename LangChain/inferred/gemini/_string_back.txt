## Mapping and Reasoning

Here's a mapping from placeholder variable names to descriptive names and types, along with explanations for each inferred name:

```
{
  "param_1": "string_pointer", // Pointer to the string being processed
  "local_10": "string_length", // Length of the string
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **`param_1`**: This variable is a pointer to a long array. In the context of the code, it's highly likely that this array represents a string, where each element corresponds to a character. Therefore, we infer the name `string_pointer`.
* **`local_10`**: This variable is assigned the result of various operations on `param_1`. Specifically, it checks if `param_1` is null or if the second element of `param_1` (which could represent the null terminator) is 0. If either condition is true, `local_10` is set to 0. Otherwise, it's assigned the sum of the first element and the second element of `param_1`, minus 1. This suggests that `local_10` represents the length of the string, excluding the null terminator. Hence, we infer the name `string_length`.
