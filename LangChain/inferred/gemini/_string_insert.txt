## Mapping of Placeholder Names to Descriptive Names and Types

Here's a mapping of the placeholder names to descriptive names and types in snake_case format, along with explanations for each:

```
{
  "param_1": string_object, // Pointer to the String object
  "param_2": position, // Position where the string will be inserted
  "param_3": str_item, // The string to be inserted
  "sVar1": str_item_length, // Length of the string to be inserted
  "lVar2": new_length, // New length of the String object after insertion
  "lVar3": new_memory_block, // Pointer to the newly allocated memory block
}
```

**Explanations:**

* `param_1`: This is a pointer to the `String` object. Since it's the main object being manipulated, a more descriptive name like `string_object` is more appropriate.
* `param_2`: This is the position where the new string will be inserted. `position` clearly reflects its purpose.
* `param_3`: This is the string that needs to be inserted. `str_item` clearly indicates its role.
* `sVar1`: This holds the length of the string to be inserted. `str_item_length` accurately describes its content.
* `lVar2`: This represents the new length of the `String` object after the insertion. `new_length` reflects this change.
* `lVar3`: This points to the newly allocated memory block if the original one wasn't large enough. `new_memory_block` describes its function. 

**Additional Notes:**

* The code snippet seems to be related to string manipulation within a custom `String` object. The placeholder names like `param_1`, `param_2`, etc., are not very informative and can be confusing. Using descriptive names based on their context and purpose improves code readability and maintainability.
* The function checks for various errors like null pointers, out-of-bounds positions, and memory allocation failures. 
* It uses functions like `_strlen`, `_memory_pool_allocate`, `___memcpy_chk`, and `___memmove_chk` for string length calculation, memory allocation, and memory copy operations.

I hope this explanation is helpful!
