{
  "param_1": "the_string",
  "param_2": "repeat_count"
}

## Reasoning

* `param_1`: This is a pointer to the first argument of the function, which should be a String object in the Python sense (i.e., an immutable collection of characters). The placeholder name "param_1" isn't very informative and the variable actually represents a String, hence the choice of "the_string".
* `param_2`: This is the second argument of the function, and it specifies the repeat count. Naming it "repeat_count" clearly reflects its purpose, especially in combination with "the_string".
