## Mapping of placeholder names to descriptive names and types:

```
{
  "param_1": "string", // long pointer to the string object
  "local_20": "char_index", // loop index for iterating through characters in the string
  "local_9": "is_lower", // boolean flag indicating if the string is all lowercase
}
```

## Reasoning behind the inferred names:

* **param_1**: The variable `param_1` is a long pointer, and its value is used to access a string object. In the context of the function, it represents the string that needs to be checked for lowercase characters. Therefore, it is named "string".
* **local_20**: The variable `local_20` is used as a loop index to iterate through each character in the string. It starts from 0 and goes up to the length of the string (param_1[1]). Hence, it is named "char_index".
* **local_9**: The variable `local_9` stores a boolean value indicating whether all the characters in the string are lowercase. It is initialized to 0 (false) and then set to 1 (true) if all characters are lowercase. Therefore, it is named "is_lower".
