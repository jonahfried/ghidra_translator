Here is the mapping of placeholder variable names to descriptive names and their explanation:


```python 
{

"param_1":"string_object",  # This variable points to the beginning of the String object in memory

"param_2":"buffer",    # Buffer containing characters to compare against

"param_3":"pos" ,        # Position within the string object to start searching

"local_38":"index",      # Index used for iteration within the String object

"local_c" : "result" ,    # Stores final return value (index or -1 if not found)


}

```



### Reasoning:


* **`string_object`**: This name is chosen as it accurately describes the purpose of the variable which points to the starting memory address of an object of type String.

*  **`buffer`**: The name `buffer`  is selected as this variable holds the array of chars that need be compared against.

 * **`pos`**:  The variable is used to indicate  the index at  which  the  searching should begin within the  `string_object` .  Therefore the name  `pos`  is concise and accurately reflects  its role.


*   **`index`**: This variable acts  as an iterator during  the  comparison loop, traversing  the  `string object`. The name  `index` is  concise and commonly  used  in such scenarios.


 * **`result`**: The name  ‘ result’  clearly conveys that  this  variable stores final  outcome  of  comparison.
