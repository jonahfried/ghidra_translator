## Inferred Variable Names and Types

Here's a mapping of placeholder variable names to inferred names and types, along with explanations:

```
{
  "param_1": "string_object", // Pointer to the String object
  "param_2": "substring", // Pointer to the substring to search for
  "param_3": "max_position", // Maximum position to search within the string
  "local_38": "substring_occurrence", // Pointer to the current occurrence of the substring
  "local_2c": "last_occurrence_position", // Position of the last occurrence of the substring
  "local_c": "result", // Result of the function (-1 on error, position otherwise)
}
```

### Explanation

* **`param_1`**: This is a pointer to the `String` object, which contains the string to be searched. We infer the name `string_object` as it's more descriptive than `param_1`.
* **`param_2`**: This is a pointer to the substring we are searching for. We infer the name `substring` to reflect its purpose.
* **`param_3`**: This is the maximum position within the string to search. We infer the name `max_position` to clarify its role.
* **`local_38`**: This variable stores the address of the current occurrence of the substring found during the search. We infer the name `substring_occurrence` to reflect its content.
* **`local_2c`**: This variable stores the position of the last occurrence of the substring found. We infer the name `last_occurrence_position` to be more descriptive than `local_2c`.
* **`local_c`**: This variable stores the final result of the function, which is either -1 on error or the position of the last occurrence. We infer the name `result` to be more general and understandable.

## Reasoning

The inferred names are chosen based on their context and usage within the code. They are meant to be more descriptive and easier to understand than the original placeholder names. 

For example, `param_1` is clearly a pointer to some important data, but it's not clear what that data is. By inferring the name `string_object`, we make the code much easier to read and understand. 

Similarly, `local_38` is a pointer to some memory location, but it's not clear what that memory location contains. By inferring the name `substring_occurrence`, we clarify the purpose of this variable and make the code more readable.

The inferred names are also chosen to be consistent with Python naming conventions, using snake_case for variable names. This makes the code more consistent and easier to read for Python developers.
