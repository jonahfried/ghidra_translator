## Inferred Variable Names and Reasoning

Here's the mapping of placeholder names to inferred names and types, along with explanations:

```
{
  "param_1": "character", // represents a single character
  "local_10": "char_len", // length of the character string in bytes
}
```

### Reasoning

* **`param_1`**: This variable receives a single character as input. We infer its type as `char` and name it `character` to reflect its purpose.
* **`local_10`**: This variable stores the length of the character string in bytes. We infer its type as `int` and name it `char_len` to clearly indicate its meaning.

### Explanation of the Code

The code defines a function `_string_utf8_char_len` that takes a single character as input and returns its length in bytes. The function works by checking the first few bits of the character to determine its encoding.

* If the first bit is 0, the character is encoded in a single byte.
* If the first two bits are 110, the character is encoded in two bytes.
* If the first three bits are 1110, the character is encoded in three bytes.
* If the first four bits are 11110, the character is encoded in four bytes.

The function then returns the appropriate length based on the encoding.

## Additional Notes

* The code assumes that the input character is a valid UTF-8 character.
* The function only handles characters that are encoded in up to four bytes.
* The function does not handle surrogate pairs.

I hope this explanation is helpful! Let me know if you have any other questions.
