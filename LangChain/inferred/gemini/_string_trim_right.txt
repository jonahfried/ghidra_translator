## Step-by-Step Analysis for Variable Name Inference

**1. Parameter `param_1`:**

* **Description:** Pointer to the string object.
* **Type:** `char*`
* **Inferred name:** `string`
* **Reasoning:** `param_1` is clearly used as a pointer to the string that needs trimming. The name "string" accurately reflects its purpose and is concise in snake_case.

**2. Local variable `local_18`:**

* **Description:** Length of the string.
* **Type:** `size_t`
* **Inferred name:** `string_length`
* **Reasoning:** `local_18` is initialized with the length of the string and used later to trim the string. `string_length` better describes its usage than the generic "local_18".

## Inferred Variable Map:

```
{
  "param_1": "string",
  "local_18": "string_length"
}
```

**Additional Analysis:**

* The function _isspace is called with a character obtained from the string. This suggests that the intent of the function is to trim whitespace characters (`\t`, `\n`, `\r`) from the right end of the string.

## Conclusion:

By carefully analyzing the code's behavior and purpose, we were able to map the placeholder names to more descriptive and meaningful snake_case names. This improves the code's readability and provides a better understanding of its logic.
