## Variable Mapping & Reasoning

Here's the mapping from placeholder variable names to descriptive names:

```
{
  "param_1": "string_ptr",
  "param_2": "start_index",
  "param_3": "end_index",
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* `param_1`: This pointer points to the beginning of the string object. Since the function operates on strings, `string_ptr` accurately reflects its purpose.
* `param_2`: This parameter defines the starting index of the range to be removed. `start_index` clearly indicates its role.
* `param_3`: This parameter defines the ending index (exclusive) of the range to be removed. `end_index` precisely describes its function.

**Further Explanation:**

* The function first checks if the `string_ptr` is null or if the object it points to is empty (value of 0). If either is true, an error message is printed to standard error using `fprintf`.
* If the range defined by `start_index` and `end_index` is valid (i.e., `start_index` is less than `end_index` and both are within the string bounds), the range is removed using `memmove`. `memmove` ensures safe overlapping memory regions.
* After removing the range, the string length is updated by subtracting the removed segment's size (`end_index - start_index`).
* If the range is invalid, an error message is printed using `fprintf`.
