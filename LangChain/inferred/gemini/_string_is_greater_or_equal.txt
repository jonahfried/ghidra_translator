## Placeholder variable mapping and explanation:

```
{
  "param_1": "str1",   // First string argument, inferred from function arguments.
  "param_2": "str2",   // Second string argument, inferred from function arguments.
  "iVar1": "comparison_result", // Result of comparing the two strings, inferred from purpose.
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* `param_1` and `param_2` are likely string pointers based on their involvement in a string compare function. 
* `iVar1` is an integer result of a comparison, likely indicating the relative position of the two strings. Therefore, it's named "comparison_result".

**Additional notes:**

* The function name is `_string_is_greater_or_equal`, suggesting it checks if the first string is greater than or equal to the second.
* This code snippet only shows a small portion of the decompiled output. Depending on the surrounding context, different names might be more appropriate.
* It's important to consider the overall functionality of the code and the specific purpose of each variable when choosing descriptive names.
