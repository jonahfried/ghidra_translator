## Mapping of Placeholder Variables to Descriptive Names and Types:

```
{
  "param_1": "target_string_ptr",  // Pointer to the target string to be modified
  "param_2": "substring_to_replace",  // Pointer to the substring to be replaced
  "param_3": "replacement_substring",  // Pointer to the replacement substring
  "puVar1": "new_string",  // Pointer to the newly created string with replacements
  "pcVar2": "substring_location",  // Pointer to the location of the substring in the target string
  "local_30": "current_string_position",  // Pointer to the current position in the target string
  "sVar3": "substring_length",  // Length of the substring to be replaced
}
```

## Reasoning behind Inferred Names:

* **target_string_ptr**: This name clearly indicates that the variable points to the string that will be modified by the function.
* **substring_to_replace**: This name explicitly describes the purpose of the variable, which is to hold the substring that needs to be replaced.
* **replacement_substring**: This name clearly indicates that the variable holds the substring that will be used to replace the target substring.
* **new_string**: This name describes the purpose of the variable, which is to hold the newly created string with all the replacements.
* **substring_location**: This name describes the purpose of the variable, which is to hold the memory address of the found substring within the target string.
* **current_string_position**: This name clearly indicates that the variable points to the current position being processed within the target string during the iteration.
* **substring_length**: This name describes the purpose of the variable, which is to hold the length of the substring that needs to be replaced. This is used to advance the `current_string_position` pointer.

## Contextual Considerations:

* The function takes three arguments, all of which are pointers to character arrays.
* The function iterates through the target string, searching for the substring to replace.
* For each occurrence of the substring, the function replaces it with the replacement substring.
* The function creates a new string to hold the modified contents.
* The function assigns the new string to the target string pointer.
* The function deallocates the memory used for the new string.

## Additional Notes:

* The function assumes that the target string is null-terminated.
* The function does not handle the case where the replacement substring is longer than the substring to replace.
* The function does not check for memory allocation errors.
