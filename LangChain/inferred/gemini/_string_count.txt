## Placeholder Variable Mappings and Explanations

Here's a mapping of placeholder names to descriptive names and types, along with explanations:

```
{
    "param_1": "string_object",   # Pointer to the string object
    "param_2": "substring",         # Pointer to the substring to search for
    "_string_count": "count_occurrences", # Function to count occurrences
    "local_30": "current_position",  # Current position in the string object
    "local_28": "occurrence_count", # Number of occurrences found
    "local_10": "result",                # Final result (number of occurrences)
    "sVar1": "substring_length",     # Length of the substring
}
```

### Reasoning for Names:

* **`param_1`**: Named **`string_object`**: This aligns with the context of the code, where `param_1` is a pointer to the string object being analyzed.
* **`param_2`**: Named **`substring`**: This reflects its role as the substring to be counted within the string object.
* **`_string_count`**: Renamed to **`count_occurrences`**: This clarifies the function's purpose of counting the occurrences of a substring.
* **`local_30`**: Renamed to **`current_position`**: This indicates its role as the current position within the string object during the search.
* **`local_28`**: Renamed to **`occurrence_count`**: This clearly represents its use as a counter for the occurrences found.
* **`local_10`**: Renamed to **`result`**: This accurately reflects its role as the final result of the function (the count of occurrences).
* **`sVar1`**: Renamed to **`substring_length`**: This accurately describes its role as the length of the substring being searched for.

These descriptive names improve code readability and understanding, making it easier to follow the logic and purpose of the code.
