## Inferred variable names and types:

```
{
  "param_1": "string_object",
  "param_2": "old_str",
  "param_3": "new_str",
  "pcVar1": "found_position",
  "sVar2": "old_str_length",
  "sVar3": "new_str_length",
  "sVar4": "remaining_str_length",
  "pcVar5": "new_string_end",
  "pcVar6": "allocated_memory",
}
```

## Reasoning:

* **param_1**: This is the first parameter to the function and is a pointer to a char array.  In the context of the function, this represents the string object being modified. 
* **param_2**: The second parameter is another char pointer and represents the string to be replaced (old string).
* **param_3**: The third parameter is again a char pointer and represents the string to replace the old string with (new string).
* **pcVar1**: This variable stores the result of searching for the `old_str` within the `string_object`. If found, it points to the first occurrence of `old_str`.
* **sVar2**: This variable stores the length of the `old_str`.
* **sVar3**: This variable stores the length of the `new_str`.
* **sVar4**: This variable stores the length of the remaining string after the `old_str` has been found.
* **pcVar5**: This variable calculates the end position of the newly constructed string after replacing the `old_str`.
* **pcVar6**: This variable points to the newly allocated memory if the original string object is not large enough to hold the new string.


## Additional notes:

* The code appears to be implementing a function to replace all occurrences of a substring within a string.
* The function checks for various error conditions, such as null pointers for the input strings.
* It also handles the case where the new string is longer than the old string, requiring memory reallocation.
* The `___memcpy_chk` and `___memmove_chk` functions are likely custom implementations of the standard library functions `memcpy` and `memmove` with additional error checking.
