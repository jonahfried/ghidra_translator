## Placeholder to Descriptive Name Mapping:

```
{
  "param_1": "string_ptr",
  "local_20": "char_index",
  "local_9": "is_alphabetic",
}
```

## Reasoning:

* **param_1**: This placeholder is the first parameter of the function and points to a long. Since the function checks if the string pointed to by this parameter contains only alphabetic characters, we can infer that it represents a pointer to the string and rename it to `string_ptr`.
* **local_20**: This local variable is used as an index within the loop that iterates through the characters of the string. Therefore, we can rename it to `char_index` for clarity.
* **local_9**: This local variable stores the result of the function, indicating whether the string is alphabetic or not. Hence, we can rename it to `is_alphabetic`.

## Additional Notes:

* The type of `param_1` is inferred as `long *` based on the decompiled code. However, it's essential to verify the actual data type used in the original program to ensure accurate interpretation.
* The function assumes ASCII characters for determining alphabetic characters. If the program deals with other character sets, the logic might need adjustments.
