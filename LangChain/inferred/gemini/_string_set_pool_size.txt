## Mapping placeholders to descriptive names:

Here's a mapping of placeholder names to inferred names and types:

```
{
  "param_1": "string_set_pointer", // Pointer to the string set
  "param_2": "new_pool_size",       // Size of the new memory pool
  "lVar1": "new_memory_pool",      // New memory pool created
  "local_9": "success",              // Indicates success or failure
}
```

## Explanation of inferred names:

- **`string_set_pointer`**: This is a pointer to the string set being modified. The name "string_set" would be too generic, and "string_set_ptr" would be redundant, so `string_set_pointer` is chosen to be descriptive and concise.
- **`new_pool_size`**: This is the size of the new memory pool to be created. "New_size" would be sufficient, but adding "pool" clarifies its purpose.
- **`new_memory_pool`**: This is the newly created memory pool. "New_mem_pool" would be shorter, but "new_memory_pool" is more descriptive. 
- **`success`**: This indicates whether the function executed successfully or not. "Result" could also be used, but "success" is more specific and fits the context of boolean return value.

## Additional notes:

* The placeholder `local_9` could also be named `result` since it directly corresponds to the return value. However, "success" is chosen to be more informative about the outcome.
* The code snippet appears to be related to resizing a string set's memory pool. 

I hope this explanation is helpful. Please let me know if you have any further questions.
