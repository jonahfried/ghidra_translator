Based on the analysis of the provided decompiled code, we can infer the purpose and types of the variables and parameters. Here is the mapping with explanations:

```json
{
  "param_1": "string_object_ptr",
  "lVar1": "current_length",
  "lVar2": "new_buffer"
}
```

### Detailed Reasoning:

1. **`param_1`**:
   - Type and Usage: It is a pointer to a `long` type, but given the operations and context (it's being dereferenced and used with indices), it's likely a pointer to an array or structure representing a string object.
   - Explanation: It is checked against NULL (indicating it's a pointer), and its indices are accessed to get and set values, which suggests it's a structure for a string object. We rename it to `string_object_ptr` to reflect that it points to a structure or array representing a string.

2. **`lVar1`**:
   - Type and Usage: It's used to store the result of an array index operation (`param_1[1]`), and it's used in arithmetic and memory operations.
   - Explanation: Given `param_1[1]` is likely the length of the string (since it's used in memory allocation and setting bounds), `lVar1` is used as a temporary storage for the current length of the string. Renaming it to `current_length` makes the purpose clear.

3. **`lVar2`**:
   - Type and Usage: It appears to be used to store the result of a memory allocation function and is later used as a destination in a memory copy operation.
   - Explanation: This variable is used to store the address of a newly allocated memory block that seems intended to hold a possibly resized string (since it's allocated with `current_length + 1`). It is then used as the new buffer for the string data. Naming it `new_buffer` clarifies that it holds the address of this new memory space for the string.

### Additional Contextual Inferences:

- The function checks if `string_object_ptr` is not NULL and if the allocated size (`param_1[2]`) is not already optimal (`param_1[1] + 1`). It performs a memory allocation for the exact needed size of the string (`current_length + 1`), copies the old string data to the new location, and updates the string object's pointer and size metadata. This operation is typical of a "shrink to fit" function that aims to minimize the memory usage of a string to just what is necessary to hold its contents.
