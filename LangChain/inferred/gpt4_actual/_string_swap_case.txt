Based on the provided decompiled code, let's analyze and create a mapping of the placeholder variable names to more descriptive names:

1. **param_1**: This is a pointer to a `long`, but based on usage, it seems to be used as a pointer to a structure representing a string. The first element (`*param_1`) is probably a pointer to the character data of the string, and the second element (`param_1[1]`) is likely the length of the string. Thus, a better name would be `string_struct`.

   Mapping:
   ```json
   {
     "param_1": "string_struct"
   }
   ```

2. **iVar1**: This is used as a temporary storage for the results of various character checks (`_islower`, `_isupper`) and transformations (`_tolower`, `_toupper`). A descriptive name might be `char_conversion_result`.

   Mapping:
   ```json
   {
     "iVar1": "char_conversion_result"
   }
   ```

3. **local_18**: This is used as the loop index, iterating over the characters of the string. A more descriptive name would be `char_index`.

   Mapping:
   ```json
   {
     "local_18": "char_index"
   }
   ```

Combining these mappings, we have:
```json
{
  "param_1": "string_struct",
  "iVar1": "char_conversion_result",
  "local_18": "char_index"
}
```

Reasoning:
- **string_struct**: This name suggests that `param_1` is not just a pointer but points to a structured data type, in this case, a string structure containing pointer to the string data and its length.
- **char_conversion_result**: This name directly reflects the purpose of the variable, which is to store the result of character conversion functions.
- **char_index**: This name clearly indicates the role of the variable as an index for accessing characters within the string.

This mapping should provide clearer insight into the function's operation and the purpose of each variable.
