From the provided decompiled code, we can infer the purpose and type of each variable based on their usage and context within the function. Here’s the breakdown for each placeholder variable and parameter:

1. `param_1` - This parameter is a double pointer to a char, which is typically used for handling strings in C. The name `param_1` does not describe its purpose. Given its usage, where it's dereferenced (`*param_1`) when passed to `_strstr`, we can infer it points to a string (i.e., the main string in which we are checking for the presence of a substring). We can rename it to `main_string_ptr`, indicating it's a pointer to the main string.

2. `param_2` - This parameter is a single pointer to a char, typical for a C-style string. Since it's used in `_strstr` as the substring we are searching for in `*param_1`, a better name would be `substring`, clearly indicating its purpose in the function.

3. `local_9` - This local variable is of type `bool` and it holds the result of whether the substring is found within the main string. A more descriptive name would be `substring_found`, indicating its role as a boolean flag for the presence of the substring.

4. `pcVar1` - This variable is used to capture the return from `_strstr`, which is a pointer to the first occurrence of `param_2` within `*param_1`, or `NULL` if not found. A suitable name could be `found_position`, which suggests it points to the location where the substring begins in the main string, or is `NULL` if the substring is not present.

5. `PTR____stderrp_10000a038` - This pointer appears to be used for accessing the standard error stream (`stderr`) for error logging. Although it's represented here as a placeholder name, its purpose is clear: it points to `stderr`. Since the name contains obfuscated parts that are likely specific to how the binary was compiled or how memory is managed, we can consider renaming it more generically if needed, such as `std_error_ptr`, but this might not be necessary as it’s directly associated with a standard C library identifier.

Mapping the placeholder names to more descriptive names, we get:

```json
{
  "param_1": "main_string_ptr",
  "param_2": "substring",
  "local_9": "substring_found",
  "pcVar1": "found_position",
  "PTR____stderrp_10000a038": "std_error_ptr" // Optional as explained
}
```

These names provide a clearer understanding of each variable's role within the function `_string_contains`, making the code easier to read and maintain.
