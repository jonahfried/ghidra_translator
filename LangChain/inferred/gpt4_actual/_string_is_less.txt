Here's the analysis of the provided function `_string_is_less` to infer the types and purposes of the variables and parameters:

1. **Function Name and Purpose**: The function is named `_string_is_less`, which suggests it determines if one string is lexicographically less than another string. This is a common utility in sorting or comparing strings.

2. **Parameters**:
    - `param_1` and `param_2`: Both are of type `undefined8`. This generally indicates an 8-byte type, likely a pointer to a string (given the context of string comparison). Since these are being compared, it makes sense to name them `string1` and `string2` respectively.
    
3. **Local Variables**:
    - `iVar1`: This is an integer variable that stores the result of `_string_compare(param_1, param_2)`. The function `_string_compare` likely returns an integer indicating the result of the comparison: negative if the first string is less, zero if equal, and positive if the first is greater. Naming it `compare_result` would make its purpose clear.

4. **Return Type**:
    - The function returns a boolean value, which is a result of the comparison `iVar1 < 0`. This means it returns `true` if the first string (`string1`) is lexicographically less than the second string (`string2`), and `false` otherwise.

Mapping in the requested format with reasoning provided:

```json
{
  "param_1": "string1",
  "param_2": "string2",
  "iVar1": "compare_result"
}
```

This mapping provides clear, descriptive names that reflect the usage and context within the function, enhancing readability and maintainability of the code.
