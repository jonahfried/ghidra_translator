This function appears to convert an integer into a string and return a pointer to the newly allocated string. Let's go through the variables one by one:

1. `param_1`: This is the input parameter to the function. It is declared as `undefined4`, which in Ghidra terms typically represents a 4-byte data type, likely an `int` in this context. Since it is used in a formatted string with the specifier `%d`, it is indeed an integer. Therefore, a good name for this variable would be `input_integer`.

2. `sVar1`: This variable is used to store the return value of `_strlen`, which calculates the length of a string. Hence, `sVar1` represents the length of the string that is formed from the integer. A descriptive name could be `string_length`.

3. `pvVar2`: This variable is used to store the result of `_malloc`, which allocates memory. Since the memory is intended to hold a string, and `pvVar2` is returned by the function, a suitable name would be `allocated_string`.

4. `local_1c`: This is a character array used as a buffer in which `___sprintf_chk` writes a formatted string. Since it temporarily holds the string representation of the integer, a good name might be `temp_string_buffer`.

5. `local_10`: This is used in conjunction with `PTR____stack_chk_guard_10000a030` for stack smashing protection. It's a common pattern in C to protect against buffer overflows. The variable `local_10` stores a copy of the stack check guard value at the start of the function, and it is compared at the end of the function to see if stack corruption has occurred. Thus, a descriptive name for this variable could be `stack_check_guard_copy`.

Here is the mapping in the requested format:

```json
{
  "param_1": "input_integer",
  "sVar1": "string_length",
  "pvVar2": "allocated_string",
  "local_1c": "temp_string_buffer",
  "local_10": "stack_check_guard_copy"
}
```

These names provide a clear understanding of the role of each variable in the function, aiding in code readability and maintainability.
