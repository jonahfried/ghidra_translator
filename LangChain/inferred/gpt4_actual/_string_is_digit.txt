From the provided decompiled code, we can infer a lot about the types and roles of the various variables and parameters. Let's go through them:

1. `param_1`:
   - Type: `long *`
   - Inferred Name: `string_object`
   - Reasoning: The parameter is a pointer, which is checked against NULL, suggesting it could be some form of complex data structure like an object. It is also used in a way that suggests accessing members of a structured data (like a string object with length and data). The dereference `param_1[1]` likely accesses the length of the string, and `*param_1` seems to access the actual string data.

2. `local_20`:
   - Type: `ulong` (unsigned long)
   - Inferred Name: `index`
   - Reasoning: This variable is used as a loop counter to iterate over each character of the string. It starts from 0 and increments until it reaches the string length (`param_1[1]`), which is characteristic of an index variable.

3. `local_9`:
   - Type: `undefined`
   - Inferred Name: `is_digit_result`
   - Reasoning: This variable stores the result of the function to indicate whether the string consists only of digit characters. It is set to 0 if any character is not a digit (when the string is NULL or contains non-digit characters) and set to 1 if all characters in the string are digits.

Mapping in the requested format would look like this:
```json
{
  "param_1": "string_object",
  "local_20": "index",
  "local_9": "is_digit_result"
}
```

This mapping replaces placeholder names with more descriptive, context-aware names that make the code easier to understand and maintain. Each name reflects the variable's role within the function, enhancing readability and aiding in future code reviews or modifications.
