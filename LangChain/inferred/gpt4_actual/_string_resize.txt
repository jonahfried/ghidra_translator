Given the provided decompiled code, let's analyze and map the placeholder variable and parameter names to more descriptive and context-appropriate names:

1. **param_1**:
   - **Type:** `long*` (pointer to long)
   - **Inferred Name:** `string_object`
   - **Reasoning:** This parameter is used like an array with indexes `[1]` and `[2]` used to store string-related information, suggesting that it could be a structure or an array representing a string object. Accesses to indices imply storing string length and capacity, typical in string management.

2. **param_2**:
   - **Type:** `ulong` (unsigned long)
   - **Inferred Name:** `new_size`
   - **Reasoning:** This parameter is used to set a new size for the string, as indicated by the comparison and resizing operations performed in the function.

3. **lVar1**:
   - **Type:** `long`
   - **Inferred Name:** `new_memory_address`
   - **Reasoning:** This variable receives the result from `_memory_pool_allocate`, which is typically a memory address, hence it's likely a pointer to the newly allocated memory for the resized string.

4. **PTR____stderrp_10000a038**:
   - **Type:** `FILE**`
   - **Inferred Name:** `stderr_pointer`
   - **Reasoning:** This pointer is used in conjunction with `fprintf` to output error messages to the standard error stream, suggesting it points to `stderr`.

5. **_memory_pool_allocate**:
   - **Type:** Function
   - **Inferred Name:** `memory_pool_allocate`
   - **Reasoning:** The function is used to allocate memory, likely from a memory pool based on its name and usage, which includes a size parameter plus one (for a null terminator typically used in strings).

6. **___memcpy_chk**:
   - **Type:** Function
   - **Inferred Name:** `secure_memcpy`
   - **Reasoning:** This function is clearly a safer version of `memcpy` (indicated by `_chk`), used to copy memory securely, preventing buffer overflows.

7. **___memset_chk**:
   - **Type:** Function
   - **Inferred Name:** `secure_memset`
   - **Reasoning:** Similar to `secure_memcpy`, this function sets memory securely and is used here to zero out the new part of the resized string.

Mapping in the requested format:
```json
{
  "param_1": "string_object",
  "param_2": "new_size",
  "lVar1": "new_memory_address",
  "PTR____stderrp_10000a038": "stderr_pointer",
  "_memory_pool_allocate": "memory_pool_allocate",
  "___memcpy_chk": "secure_memcpy",
  "___memset_chk": "secure_memset"
}
```

This mapping and naming are based on the context provided by the function's operations, which include error handling, memory allocation, and manipulation characteristic of string resizing functions.
