From the provided decompiled code, we can infer the purpose and type of each parameter and variable based on their usage within the function `_string_remove_range`. Let's analyze each placeholder name:

1. `param_1`:
   - **Usage**: This parameter is repeatedly dereferenced (`*param_1`, `param_1[1]`) and is checked for being a NULL pointer. The first dereference `*param_1` seems to be used as a base address in memory operations like `___memmove_chk`. The second element, `param_1[1]`, is used as a length or size, which is modified at the end.
   - **Inferred Name and Type**: `string_data` of type `long*` (pointer to long). This suggests it likely represents a structure where the first element points to a character array (the string data) and the second element represents the length of the string.

2. `param_2`:
   - **Usage**: Used as a starting index (or offset) in a memory move operation (`memmove`) and in range checks with `param_3`.
   - **Inferred Name and Type**: `start_index` of type `ulong` (unsigned long). This name reflects its role as the starting point of the range to remove from the string.

3. `param_3`:
   - **Usage**: Used as an ending index in a memory move operation and in range checks with `param_2` and `param_1[1]`.
   - **Inferred Name and Type**: `end_index` of type `ulong` (unsigned long). This name indicates its role as the endpoint of the range to remove from the string.

4. `PTR____stderrp_10000a038`:
   - **Usage**: Used for error logging to stderr.
   - **Inferred Name and Type**: `stderr_ptr` of type `FILE**`. The name suggests that this global pointer is used to reference the standard error stream.

Based on these inferences, the mapping of placeholder names to inferred names would be as follows:
```json
{
  "param_1": "string_data",
  "param_2": "start_index",
  "param_3": "end_index",
  "PTR____stderrp_10000a038": "stderr_ptr"
}
```

This mapping provides clearer and more descriptive names that reflect the usage and types of the variables within the function `_string_remove_range`.
