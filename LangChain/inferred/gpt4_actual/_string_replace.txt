The provided function `_string_replace` appears to replace occurrences of a substring in a string with another substring, adjusting the memory dynamically if necessary. Let's break down each placeholder variable and infer a meaningful name and type based on the context of their usage.

### Parameter Analysis
- **param_1**: This is a pointer to a pointer of `char`, suggesting it could be pointing to an array of `char` pointers, possibly holding a dynamically allocated string and metadata about it. Given the usage in memory-related operations and checks, it might represent a structure like `char** string_handle`.
- **param_2**: A `char*` that represents the substring to be replaced in the target string, best described as `char* old_substring`.
- **param_3**: A `char*` that represents the substring that will replace occurrences of `param_2` in the target string, described as `char* new_substring`.

### Local Variable Analysis
- **pcVar1**: Used to store the result of `_strstr`, which searches for a substring in a string, so it likely represents the position of the found substring. It should be named `char* found_position`.
- **sVar2**: Stores the length of `param_2` (`old_substring`), thus this can be named `size_t old_length`.
- **sVar3**: Stores the length of `param_3` (`new_substring`), thus this can be named `size_t new_length`.
- **sVar4**: Holds the length of the part of the string after the found substring, namely the suffix following the `old_substring`. We can name it `size_t suffix_length`.
- **pcVar5**: Calculates the new position or size related to new memory allocation or string adjustment. Its usage suggests it represents a new end position or required size for the string after replacement. Call it `char* new_end_position`.
- **pcVar6**: This variable is used as a destination in memory allocation and copying operations, implying it's a pointer to a newly allocated string or buffer. A suitable name would be `char* new_buffer`.

### Mapping
```json
{
  "param_1": "string_handle",
  "param_2": "old_substring",
  "param_3": "new_substring",
  "pcVar1": "found_position",
  "sVar2": "old_length",
  "sVar3": "new_length",
  "sVar4": "suffix_length",
  "pcVar5": "new_end_position",
  "pcVar6": "new_buffer"
}
```

### Reasoning
- The parameter names were inferred based on their roles as inputs to the function, specifically their role in string manipulation as target strings and substrings for replacement.
- The local variables were named based on their usage in string manipulation (finding positions, lengths, and handling memory allocation and copying), reflecting their purposes within the function's operations.
