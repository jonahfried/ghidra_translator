Let's analyze the function `_string_pop_back` and infer more descriptive variable names for the placeholder `param_1` based on the contextual clues in the decompiled code. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the code and the reasoning behind each inferred name:

1. **Function Name and Purpose**: The function name `_string_pop_back` suggests that this function is designed to remove the last character from a string-like structure. This gives us a hint that `param_1` likely refers to some kind of string or data structure representing a string.

2. **Parameter Check**: The first `if` statement checks if `param_1` is equal to `NULL` (0x0 in hexadecimal), indicating that `param_1` is a pointer. If `param_1` is `NULL`, an error message is printed to the standard error stream, confirming that `param_1` should represent a valid memory address expected to point to a string or a string-like object.

3. **Second `if` Check**: The second condition `param_1[1] == 0` checks the value at the memory offset from `param_1`. This suggests that `param_1` is not just a simple pointer to a character array but likely a pointer to a structure or an array where `param_1[1]` denotes the length of the string or a similar attribute.

4. **String Manipulation**: The main operation in the `else` clause, `*(undefined *)(*param_1 + param_1[1] - 1) = 0;`, modifies the character in the string. The code calculates an address by adding `*param_1` (which is likely the base address of the characters of the string) and `param_1[1] - 1` (which adjusts the length to get the last character index) and sets it to zero (likely a null-terminator in a C-style string). This confirms that `param_1[0]` points to the start of the character data and `param_1[1]` stores the length of the string.

5. **Updating the Length**: Finally, `param_1[1] = param_1[1] - 1;` reduces the length of the string by one, which aligns with the function's purpose of popping the last character from the string.

Based on this analysis, a possible and more descriptive naming for `param_1` could be:
```json
{
  "param_1" : "string_struct_ptr"
}
```
Here, `string_struct_ptr` suggests that this is a pointer to a structure (or an array treated like a structure) where the first element is the pointer to the string data and the second element is the length of the string. This naming provides clarity on the role and structure of the variable in the context of this function.
