Based on the analysis of the given function `_string_reverse`, which appears to reverse a string encapsulated within a custom String object in C, we can deduce the following variables and their meaningful names:

```json
{
  "param_1": "string_obj_ptr",
  "pvVar1": "reversed_buffer",
  "uVar2": "original_c_string",
  "local_20": "write_index",
  "local_1c": "read_index"
}
```

**Explanation of Each Inferred Name:**

1. **`param_1`**: Renamed to `string_obj_ptr`. This is a pointer to a custom String object. The check `param_1 == (long *)0x0` and `*param_1 == 0` suggests that `param_1` is expected to point to a structure (possibly a String object) where the first element can be null (indicative of an empty or uninitialized string). The `param_1[1]` usage indicates it's accessing the length of the string, commonly stored in a struct representing strings.

2. **`pvVar1`**: Renamed to `reversed_buffer`. This variable is used to store the result of the reversed string. It is allocated memory of size `param_1[1] + 1` (length of the string plus one for the null terminator), which confirms it's used as a buffer.

3. **`uVar2`**: Renamed to `original_c_string`. After reversing the string into `reversed_buffer`, `uVar2` is assigned the result of `_string_c_str(param_1)`, which likely converts the custom string object into a C-style string (null-terminated). This variable is then used as an argument in `_string_replace`, suggesting its role as a representation of the original string.

4. **`local_20`**: Renamed to `write_index`. This variable is used as an index to write into `reversed_buffer`. It starts at 0 and increments as the function writes characters from the end of the original string to the beginning of the `reversed_buffer`.

5. **`local_1c`**: Renamed to `read_index`. This variable is used to read characters from the original string from the end to the beginning (`local_1c = local_1c + -1`). This decrementing index is used to access characters in reverse order from the original string's data.

The code essentially performs a reverse operation on a string, storing the result in a temporary buffer, and then replaces the original string with this reversed version in the custom string object, ensuring to handle memory allocation and free operations correctly.
