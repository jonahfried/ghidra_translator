Analyzing the decompiled code, we can identify and rename the variables to make the code more understandable:

1. **param_1**: It's a pointer to a long, but given the context, it's likely some kind of structure or object representing a string. This is inferred from its usage, where the second element `param_1[1]` is accessed and appears to be used in a length or size comparison:
   - **string_object**: `long*` (represents a pointer to a string object, where the first element might be a pointer to the character data and the second element the length of the string).

2. **param_2**: Used in comparisons as a starting position for a substring operation:
   - **start_position**: `ulong` (unsigned long indicating the starting index of the substring).

3. **param_3**: Used as a length for the substring and also in boundary checking:
   - **substring_length**: `void*` (should be cast to an appropriate numeric type like `size_t` or similar, depending on the system and context).

4. **local_28**: Stores a modified length of the substring or a dynamically calculated value based on bounds checking:
   - **calculated_length**: `void*` (similarly should be a numeric type, reflecting the actual length of the substring that can be safely extracted).

5. **local_10**: This appears to be a pointer to a new string object (or similar structure) being created and returned by the function:
   - **new_string_object**: `void**` (pointer to a new string object).

6. **pvVar1**: Temporary variable used to store the result of a memory allocation:
   - **allocated_memory**: `void*` (pointer to the dynamically allocated memory space for the substring).

With these inferred names, the mapping from placeholder names to descriptive names and types would look like:

```json
{
  "param_1": "string_object",
  "param_2": "start_position",
  "param_3": "substring_length",
  "local_28": "calculated_length",
  "local_10": "new_string_object",
  "pvVar1": "allocated_memory"
}
```

This mapping and renaming provide a clearer insight into what each variable represents and is used for in the function, making the code more readable and maintainable.
