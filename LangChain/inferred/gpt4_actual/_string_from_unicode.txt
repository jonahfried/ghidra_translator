Here is the mapping from the placeholder variable names to more descriptive names based on the provided code context:

```json
{
  "param_1": "input_wide_string",
  "sVar1": "bytes_converted",
  "pcVar2": "converted_string",
  "local_10": "result_string"
}
```

### Explanation of the names:
1. **param_1**: Renamed to `input_wide_string`. This variable represents the input parameter to the function, which is a pointer to a wide character string (`wchar_t*`). The context indicates that this function is designed to convert a Unicode wide string to a regular string.

2. **sVar1**: Renamed to `bytes_converted`. This variable captures the return value of `_wcstombs` when called with a `NULL` destination to determine the number of bytes needed to perform the conversion. It essentially measures the length needed to store the converted string, hence `bytes_converted` is descriptive of its role.

3. **pcVar2**: Renamed to `converted_string`. This variable is used to store the pointer returned by `_malloc`, which points to the memory allocated for the converted string. It is then used as the destination in the `_wcstombs` call to actually perform the conversion, making `converted_string` an apt description.

4. **local_10**: Renamed to `result_string`. This variable is used to store the result of the conversion process which is either `0` (indicating failure) or a successful conversion result from `_string_create`. The name `result_string` indicates its purpose as the output of the function.

Each name was chosen to clearly reflect the role of the variable within the function, improving the readability and maintainability of the code.
