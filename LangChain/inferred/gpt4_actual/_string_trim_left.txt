### Explanation of the Inferred Names

1. **param_1**: Renamed to `string_object_ptr` because it is a pointer to a string object. From the usage in the function, it seems it points to a structure where `string_object_ptr[0]` is the start of the character data and `string_object_ptr[1]` holds the length of the string.

2. **iVar1**: Renamed to `is_space_result`, as it captures the result from the `_isspace()` function, which checks if a character is a whitespace. The function returns non-zero (interpreted as true) if the character is a whitespace.

3. **bVar2**: Renamed to `is_whitespace`, as it is used as a boolean flag to indicate whether the current character being examined is a whitespace. It is directly set based on the result of `_isspace()` through `is_space_result`.

4. **local_18**: Renamed to `trim_index`, as it is used to navigate through the string from the beginning, identifying how many characters to trim. It increments until a non-whitespace character is found, effectively representing the index up to which characters are to be trimmed from the left side of the string.

These names are chosen to clearly represent the purpose and role of each variable within the function, enhancing readability and maintainability of the code.
