In the provided function `_string_shuffle`, the function is designed to shuffle the characters of a string. Let's analyze each variable and infer appropriate names and types:

1. `param_1` - This is a pointer to a pointer to a char, which in C is commonly used to handle strings (character arrays). Since it is used here to refer to a string that will be shuffled, a good name might be `string_ptr`. It is used to access and modify the string directly.

2. `cVar1` - This variable is used to temporarily hold a character value during the shuffling process. A descriptive name could be `temp_char`, and it is of type `char`.

3. `iVar2` - This variable is used to store the return value of the `_rand()` function, which generates a random number. A fitting name could be `random_index`, and it is of type `int`.

4. `tVar3` - This variable is used to hold the current time value obtained from `_time()`, which is then used to seed the random number generator `_srand()`. It should be named `current_time` and is of type `time_t`.

5. `uVar4` - This variable is used to store the length of the string (as returned by `_strlen()`) and also appears as part of the calculation for the shuffling algorithm. A suitable name could be `string_length`, and it’s of type `ulong` (unsigned long).

6. `local_20` - This variable is assigned the value of `uVar4 - 1` and is used as a counter in the loop that performs the shuffling. It decreases in each iteration until it reaches zero. A good name would be `shuffle_index`, and it’s of type `ulong`.

Mapping these variables to their inferred names and types, the mapping would be:
```json
{
  "param_1": "string_ptr",
  "cVar1": "temp_char",
  "iVar2": "random_index",
  "tVar3": "current_time",
  "uVar4": "string_length",
  "local_20": "shuffle_index"
}
```

Each name has been chosen to reflect the role of the variable in the function and follows the snake_case convention as requested.
