In the provided code snippet, the function `_string_to_capitalize` takes a double pointer `param_1` which points to a string, and intends to capitalize the first letter of the string if various conditions are met. Hereâ€™s the mapping and reasoning for each placeholder name:

```
{
  "param_1": "string_ptr",
  "iVar1": "capitalized_char"
}
```

### Reasoning:

1. **param_1**: It is a double pointer, `char **`, suggesting it points to a string (char pointer). Given the checks and operations performed in the code, it likely represents a pointer to the first character of a string, which is a common way to handle strings in C for modification. Naming it `string_ptr` makes it clear that it points to a string that may be modified.

2. **iVar1**: This variable is used to store the result of `_toupper` function, which converts the first character of the string to uppercase if it is an alphabetic character. The function `_toupper` typically takes a character (as an integer) and returns its uppercase equivalent (also as an integer). Here, `iVar1` is then used to replace the first character of the string with its uppercase version. Naming it `capitalized_char` clearly reflects its purpose and content.

These names provide a clearer indication of the role and type of each variable in the function, simplifying understanding and maintenance of the code.
