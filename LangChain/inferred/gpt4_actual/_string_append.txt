To provide a mapping of the placeholder variable names to more descriptive names, let's analyze the function and its usage of these variables:

### Function Signature
```c
void _string_append(long *param_1, char *param_2)
```
- **param_1**: This appears to be a pointer to a structure or an array used to manage a dynamic string. It's being dereferenced and accessed at multiple positions like an array.
- **param_2**: Clearly, this is a pointer to a character array, i.e., a string that is intended to be appended to the string managed by `param_1`.

### Variables Inside the Function
- **sVar1**: This variable is used to store the result of `_strlen(param_2)`, which is the length of the string to be appended. Thus, it is the length of the string to append.
- **lVar2**: This variable is used to calculate the new required size for memory allocation (`param_1[1] + sVar1 + 1`). It represents the new total size needed for the string, including the new content.
- **lVar3**: This is used to hold the result from `_memory_pool_allocate`, which suggests it's a pointer to newly allocated memory.

### Array/Index Usage in `param_1`
- `param_1[0]` is used to hold a pointer (because it’s being assigned from `lVar3` which is a memory address). We can infer this is the current buffer holding the string.
- `param_1[1]` seems to store the current length of the string (since it's used in calculations related to string length and memory allocation).
- `param_1[2]` seems to store the total allocated size for the string (since it’s compared with the sum of current length and the length of the string to append).
- `param_1[3]` is used as an argument to `_memory_pool_allocate`, which likely means it’s some kind of memory pool identifier or handle.

### Mapping
Based on the analysis, the mapping from placeholder names to descriptive names would be:
```json
{
  "param_1": "string_handle",
  "param_2": "append_str",
  "sVar1": "append_length",
  "lVar2": "new_total_length",
  "lVar3": "new_buffer_ptr",
  "string_handle[0]": "current_buffer",
  "string_handle[1]": "current_length",
  "string_handle[2]": "allocated_size",
  "string_handle[3]": "memory_pool_id"
}
```

### Reasoning
- `param_1` is treated as a handle or reference to a string object (thus `string_handle`).
- `param_2` is the string to append, hence `append_str`.
- `sVar1` holds the length of the string to append, so `append_length`.
- `lVar2` is calculated as the new required size for the string buffer, thus `new_total_length`.
- `lVar3` is a pointer to the newly allocated memory, so `new_buffer_ptr`.
- Indices in `string_handle` are interpreted based on their usage: `[0]` as `current_buffer`, `[1]` as `current_length`, `[2]` as `allocated_size`, and `[3]` as `memory_pool_id` (since it's used to specify where to allocate memory).
