The function `_string_find_first_of` appears to be a utility for finding the first occurrence of a substring in a main string starting from a specified position. The variable names used are placeholders and can be improved for better understanding. Here's a detailed explanation and mapping of each placeholder variable name to a more descriptive one:

1. `param_1`: This parameter is a pointer to a long value. From the usage in the code, it seems to represent a pointer to a structure related to a string (probably a custom string object). This structure probably holds the address of the string itself and additional metadata such as its length. 
   - Suggested name and type: `string_obj_ptr` : `long*`

2. `param_2`: This is a character pointer used to represent the substring that we are trying to find within the main string.
   - Suggested name and type: `search_string` : `char*`

3. `param_3`: This unsigned long parameter is used to specify the starting position for the search within the main string. 
   - Suggested name and type: `start_position` : `ulong`

4. `pcVar1`: This character pointer is used to hold the result from `_strstr`, which is a function that returns a pointer to the first occurrence of `param_2` in the string starting from `param_3`. 
   - Suggested name and type: `found_substr_ptr` : `char*`

5. `local_c`: This is a local integer variable used to store the result of the function. It holds the position of the first occurrence of the substring or -1 if an error occurs or the substring is not found.
   - Suggested name and type: `result_position` : `int`

6. `PTR____stderrp_10000a038`: This appears to be a pointer to a `FILE*` for stderr, used for error logging.
   - Suggested name and type: `stderr_ptr` : `FILE**`

Here is the mapping in the required format:

```json
{
  "param_1" : "string_obj_ptr",
  "param_2" : "search_string",
  "param_3" : "start_position",
  "pcVar1" : "found_substr_ptr",
  "local_c" : "result_position",
  "PTR____stderrp_10000a038" : "stderr_ptr"
}
```

This renaming provides a clearer understanding of the function's parameters and local variables, their roles, and their types based on the context of the operations performed within the function.
