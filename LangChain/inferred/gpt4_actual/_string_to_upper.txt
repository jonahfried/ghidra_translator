Let's analyze the provided function `_string_to_upper` and construct a mapping of placeholder names to more descriptive names based on their usage and context.

1. **param_1**: This is the input parameter of the function, and given how it is used, it appears to be a pointer to a structure or array where:
   - `param_1[0]` seems to point to the base address of a string.
   - `param_1[1]` seems to be the length of the string.
   
   A suitable name could be `string_info`, indicating that it contains information related to a string.

2. **iVar1**: This variable is used to store the return values from functions `_isalpha` and `_toupper`. It is used temporarily to hold data needed for conditional checks and transformations.
   
   A meaningful name would be `char_transformation_result` as it holds the result after checking if a character is alphabetic and potentially transforming it to uppercase.

3. **local_28**: This variable is used as a loop counter and index for accessing characters in the string. Therefore, a name like `char_index` would be more descriptive.

4. **local_10**: This variable is used to hold a pointer to the newly allocated memory intended for the uppercase version of the string. A name such as `uppercase_string` is both descriptive and concise.

5. **PTR____stderrp_10000a038**: This appears to be a pointer to the standard error file stream (`stderr`). A rename is not necessary here as this is likely a global variable predefined elsewhere in the codebase.

Here's the mapping in the requested format:
```json
{
  "param_1" : "string_info",
  "iVar1" : "char_transformation_result",
  "local_28" : "char_index",
  "local_10" : "uppercase_string"
}
```

### Explanation of Reasoning:
- **string_info**: This name indicates that the variable holds information about a string, encompassing both the pointer to the string and its length.
- **char_transformation_result**: This name reflects the variable's role in holding the result of character-related checks and transformations.
- **char_index**: This name accurately describes the variable's use as an index for iterating through characters in a string.
- **uppercase_string**: This name directly states that the variable holds a pointer to a string that is intended to be an uppercase version of the original string.

This naming provides clarity on the roles of each variable, improving the readability and maintainability of the code.
