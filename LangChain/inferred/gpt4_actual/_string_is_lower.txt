Here's the mapping from placeholder variable names to more descriptive names based on the context provided by the decompiled code:

```json
{
  "param_1": "string_object",
  "local_20": "char_index",
  "local_9": "is_all_lower"
}
```

### Explanation of the Inferred Names

1. **param_1**: 
   - This parameter appears to be a pointer to a complex data structure, potentially representing a string object. It's a `long *`, and the code checks if it's `NULL`, indicating it might be dynamically allocated or optional. Its second element (`param_1[1]`) is used in a loop, likely representing the length of the string. Hence, the name `string_object` is descriptive of its role.

2. **local_20**: 
   - Declared as `ulong`, this variable is used to index through characters in a string within a loop that iterates from `0` to the length of the string (`param_1[1]`). This suggests that it is serving as an index for the characters in the string, so `char_index` is a fitting name.

3. **local_9**: 
   - This variable is used to store the return value of the function, initially set to `0` and potentially modified to `1` depending on whether all characters in the string are lowercase. The function name `_string_is_lower` and the return type `undefined` (which might be a placeholder for a boolean or similar simple type in decompiled code) suggest that `local_9` is intended to indicate whether the string is entirely lowercase (`1` for true, `0` for false). Thus, `is_all_lower` adequately describes its purpose.

This renaming provides a clearer understanding of the purpose and function of each variable within the code.
