In the provided function `_string_to_title`, the placeholder variable names can be mapped to more descriptive names based on their usage and context in the function. Here's the analysis and mapping:

1. `param_1`: This is a pointer (of type `long *`), and it seems to be used to refer to a string object. The first element of this pointer (`*param_1`) appears to point to the actual string data, and the second element (`param_1[1]`) seems to store the length of the string. Hence, a good name can be `string_object_ptr`.
  
2. `bVar1`: This variable is of type `bool` and is used to track whether the next character should be converted to uppercase (true) or lowercase (false). This is typically at the start of a new word. A descriptive name could be `capitalize_next_char`.

3. `iVar2`: This is an integer used to store results from functions like `_isalpha`, `_toupper`, and `_tolower`. It's a temporary variable for storing these function return values. A suitable name could be `temp_char_value`.

4. `local_20`: This is an index variable used in the loop to iterate through the characters of the string. The type `ulong` suggests that it's used for sizes or indices in memory. A self-explanatory name would be `char_index`.

Applying these inferred names, the mapping would look like:
```json
{
  "param_1" : "string_object_ptr",
  "bVar1" : "capitalize_next_char",
  "iVar2" : "temp_char_value",
  "local_20" : "char_index"
}
```

### Reasoning Behind Names:
- `string_object_ptr`: Indicates that this variable points to a structured object (in this case, a string) with multiple fields, such as data and length.
- `capitalize_next_char`: Describes the role of this variable in deciding whether the next character in the string should be capitalized, indicating its usage in formatting the string to title case.
- `temp_char_value`: Reflects its use as a temporary storage for values returned by functions dealing with character properties.
- `char_index`: Directly describes its use as an index for accessing characters in the string, making it clear what the variable is used for in the loop.
