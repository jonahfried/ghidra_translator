The provided code appears to be a function for trimming whitespace characters from the right end of a string. Here's the mapping of the placeholder variable names to more descriptive ones:

```json
{
  "param_1" : "string_ptr",
  "iVar1" : "is_space_result",
  "bVar2" : "is_space",
  "local_18" : "trim_index"
}
```

### Explanation of Inferred Names:

1. **param_1**: This parameter is a pointer to a long, which is used to access the string and its length. Given the operations in the code, it likely points to a structure or array where the first element (`*param_1`) is the address of the string, and the second element (`param_1[1]`) is the length of the string. Thus, a good name for it is `string_ptr`.

2. **iVar1**: This integer variable is used to store the result of the `_isspace` function, which checks if a given character is a whitespace character. The name `is_space_result` is chosen to reflect that it temporarily holds whether the current character is a space or not.

3. **bVar2**: This boolean variable is used to determine if the character at the current position is a whitespace character, based on the result from `_isspace`. Therefore, the name `is_space` is appropriate as it directly indicates that it's used to check if a character is a whitespace.

4. **local_18**: This variable represents the current index in the string that is being checked and potentially modified (trimmed). It starts at the end of the string and moves backward. The name `trim_index` is suitable because it indicates the index used for trimming characters from the string.

By using these names, the function's code becomes more readable and easier to understand.
