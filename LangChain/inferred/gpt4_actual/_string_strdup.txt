The provided code is a custom implementation of the string duplication function, commonly known as `strdup`. This function takes a C-style string as input and returns a new string which is a duplicate of the input string. The function handles cases where the input is `NULL` or memory allocation fails. Here's the mapping of the placeholder variable names to more descriptive names:

```json
{
  "param_1": "source_string",
  "sVar1": "source_length",
  "local_10": "duplicated_string"
}
```

Explanation:
1. **param_1**: This parameter is the input to the function and represents the string that needs to be duplicated. The name `source_string` clearly indicates that this is the source string from which a copy will be made.

2. **sVar1**: This variable is used to store the result of `_strlen(param_1)`, which calculates the length of the source string. Therefore, the name `source_length` aptly describes what it holds â€” the length of the `source_string`.

3. **local_10**: This variable is used to store the pointer to the newly allocated memory (if allocation is successful) where the duplicate string will be stored. Initially, it's used to handle the error message if the `source_string` is `NULL` and later to manage the memory allocation result. The name `duplicated_string` effectively describes its purpose, which is to point to the duplicated string. This name also reflects its final use, which is the return value of the function, representing the duplicated string.

This naming scheme provides clarity and improves readability by using descriptive and context-relevant names, which helps in understanding the function's purpose and flow at a glance.
