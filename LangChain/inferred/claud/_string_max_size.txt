Here's the mapping of placeholder names to inferred names and types, along with the reasoning:

{
  param_1: string_ptr,
  local_10: max_size
}

Reasoning:
- param_1: This parameter is likely a pointer to a String object based on the function name "_string_max_size" and the NULL check performed on param_1. Therefore, I inferred its name as "string_ptr" to indicate that it is a pointer to a String.

- local_10: This local variable is used to store and return the maximum size of the string. If the String pointer is NULL, an error message is printed, and local_10 is set to 0. Otherwise, local_10 is set to 0xffffffffffffffff, which represents the maximum possible size of the string. Therefore, I inferred its name as "max_size" to reflect its purpose of holding the maximum size value.

The function seems to be responsible for retrieving the maximum size of a String object. It takes a pointer to a String as input and returns the maximum size. If the String pointer is NULL, it prints an error message to stderr and returns 0. Otherwise, it returns the maximum possible size of the string, which is 0xffffffffffffffff.

Here's the code with the inferred names and types:

```c
undefined8 _string_max_size(String* string_ptr)
{
  undefined8 max_size;
  
  if (string_ptr == NULL) {
    _fprintf(*(FILE **)PTR____stderrp_10000a038,
             "Error: The String object is NULL in string_max_size.\n");
    max_size = 0;
  }
  else {
    max_size = 0xffffffffffffffff;
  }
  return max_size;
}
```
