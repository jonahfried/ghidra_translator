Here's the mapping of placeholder names to inferred names and types, along with the reasoning:

{
  param_1: string_ptr,
}

Reasoning:
- param_1 is likely a pointer to a string object based on the context:
  - It's being passed to functions _string_trim_left and _string_trim_right, which suggests it represents a string.
  - The error message "Error: Null String object in string_trim.\n" is printed when param_1 is 0 (NULL), indicating it's expected to be a valid string pointer.
- The name string_ptr is chosen to clearly convey that it is a pointer to a string object.
- The type of string_ptr is likely a long integer (64-bit) based on the decompiled code using long for param_1.

So, the inferred name string_ptr suggests that the parameter is a pointer to a string object, and the reasoning is based on the context in which it is used within the _string_trim function.
