Here's the mapping of placeholder names to inferred names and types, along with the reasoning:

{
  param_1: int_value,
  uVar1: result_string,
  local_1c: buffer,
  local_10: stack_guard
}

Reasoning:
1. `param_1`: This is an input parameter of type `undefined4`, which is likely an integer type. Given the context that it's being passed to `___sprintf_chk` with the format specifier `"%d"`, it's clear that it represents an integer value. Therefore, a descriptive name for it could be `int_value`.

2. `uVar1`: This variable is assigned the result of the `_string_create` function, which takes the `local_1c` buffer as input. It is then returned from the function. Based on this, it can be inferred that `uVar1` holds the resulting string created from the integer value. Hence, a suitable name for it could be `result_string`.

3. `local_1c`: This is a local array of size 12 bytes, which is used as a buffer to store the string representation of the integer value using `___sprintf_chk`. The buffer is then passed to `_string_create`. Therefore, `local_1c` can be appropriately named `buffer`.

4. `local_10`: This variable is assigned the value of `*(long *)PTR____stack_chk_guard_10000a030` at the beginning of the function and is later compared with the same value before returning. This is a common pattern used for stack protection, where a guard value is placed on the stack and checked for integrity before returning from the function. If the guard value doesn't match, it indicates a stack overflow or corruption, and `___stack_chk_fail` is called. Therefore, `local_10` can be named `stack_guard` to reflect its purpose.

The function `_string_from_int` takes an integer value `int_value` as input, converts it to a string representation using `___sprintf_chk`, and then creates a new string using `_string_create`. The resulting string `result_string` is returned from the function. The function also includes stack protection measures using the `stack_guard` variable.
