Here's the mapping of placeholder names to inferred names and types, along with the reasoning:

{
  param_1: str1,
  param_2: str2,
}

Reasoning:
- `param_1` and `param_2` are inferred to be strings because they are being passed to a function named `_string_compare`, which suggests that the function compares two strings.
- The names `str1` and `str2` are chosen to represent the first and second string parameters, respectively. These names are descriptive and concise, indicating that they are strings being compared.

The function `_string_is_greater_or_equal` takes two strings (`str1` and `str2`) as parameters and returns a boolean value indicating whether `str1` is greater than or equal to `str2` lexicographically.

Inside the function, `_string_compare` is called with `str1` and `str2` as arguments. It is assumed that `_string_compare` returns an integer value indicating the lexicographical comparison result between the two strings. The possible return values could be:
- A negative value if `str1` is less than `str2`.
- Zero if `str1` is equal to `str2`.
- A positive value if `str1` is greater than `str2`.

The returned value from `_string_compare` is then compared with -1. If the comparison result is greater than -1 (i.e., if `str1` is equal to or greater than `str2`), the function returns `true`. Otherwise, it returns `false`.

The function name `_string_is_greater_or_equal` clearly indicates its purpose of checking if one string is greater than or equal to another string.
