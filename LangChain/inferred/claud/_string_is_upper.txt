Here's the mapping of placeholder variable names to descriptive names along with the reasoning:

{
  param_1: string_ptr,
  local_20: char_index,
  local_9: is_upper,
}

Reasoning:
1. param_1: This is a pointer to a long, which likely represents a pointer to a String object. Therefore, string_ptr is a suitable name.

2. local_20: This variable is used as a loop counter to iterate over the characters of the string. It represents the index of each character. Hence, char_index is an appropriate name.

3. local_9: This variable is used to store the final result of the function. It is set to 0 if the string is NULL or if any character is not uppercase. Otherwise, it is set to 1. Therefore, is_upper is a fitting name to indicate whether the string is entirely uppercase or not.

The function _string_is_upper seems to check if all the characters in the given string are uppercase. It iterates over each character and checks if its ASCII value falls within the range of uppercase letters (between '`' and '{'). If any character is not uppercase, it immediately returns 0. If the string is NULL, it prints an error message to stderr and returns 0. If all characters are uppercase, it returns 1.
