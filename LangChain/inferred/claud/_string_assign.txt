Here's the mapping of placeholder variable names to descriptive names along with their types and reasoning:

{
  param_1: string_obj,
  param_2: new_str,
  sVar1: new_str_len,
  lVar2: new_memory,
}

Reasoning:
1. param_1 -> string_obj (type: long*):
   - It is the first parameter of the function and seems to represent a String object.
   - The function checks if param_1 is NULL and prints an error message referring to it as "The String object".

2. param_2 -> new_str (type: char*):
   - It is the second parameter of the function and represents a new string to be assigned.
   - The function checks if param_2 is NULL and prints an error message referring to it as "The newStr".

3. sVar1 -> new_str_len (type: size_t):
   - It is assigned the result of calling _strlen(param_2), which calculates the length of the string pointed to by param_2.
   - The name new_str_len clearly indicates that it represents the length of the new string.

4. lVar2 -> new_memory (type: long):
   - It is assigned the result of calling _memory_pool_allocate(param_1[3], sVar1 + 1), which allocates memory from a memory pool.
   - The allocated memory is used to store the new string, so the name new_memory reflects its purpose.

The function _string_assign seems to assign a new string (param_2) to a String object (param_1). It follows these steps:
1. It checks if the String object (param_1) and the new string (param_2) are not NULL.
2. It calculates the length of the new string (sVar1) using _strlen.
3. If the current capacity of the String object (param_1[2]) is less than the required length (sVar1 + 1), it allocates new memory (lVar2) using _memory_pool_allocate.
4. If memory allocation fails, it prints an error message and returns.
5. It updates the String object's data pointer (param_1[0]) to the newly allocated memory and updates the capacity (param_1[2]).
6. It copies the new string (param_2) to the String object's data using ___strcpy_chk.
7. It updates the length of the String object (param_1[1]) to the length of the new string (sVar1).

The function ensures that the String object has enough capacity to store the new string and reallocates memory if necessary.
