Here's the mapping of placeholder variable names to descriptive names along with their types and reasoning:

{
  param_1: string_obj,
  param_2: search_str,
  param_3: start_pos,
  pcVar1: found_ptr,
  local_c: result
}

Reasoning:
1. param_1 -> string_obj (long*): It seems to be a pointer to a String object, likely containing the string data and length. Renaming it to string_obj makes it clear that it represents the String object.

2. param_2 -> search_str (char*): This parameter is used as the search string in the _strstr function, so naming it search_str clearly indicates its purpose.

3. param_3 -> start_pos (ulong): This parameter is compared with param_1[1], which likely represents the length of the string. It appears to be the starting position for the search. Renaming it to start_pos makes its role more evident.

4. pcVar1 -> found_ptr (char*): This variable is assigned the result of _strstr, which returns a pointer to the first occurrence of the search string. Naming it found_ptr suggests that it points to the found substring.

5. local_c -> result (int): This local variable is used to store the final result of the function, which is either the index of the first occurrence of the search string or -1 if not found or an error occurs. Renaming it to result clarifies its purpose.

The function seems to be implementing a find_first_of operation on a String object. It searches for the first occurrence of a given substring (search_str) within the String object (string_obj) starting from a specified position (start_pos). If the String object or its data is NULL, or if the search string is NULL, it prints an error message and returns -1. If the starting position is out of bounds, it also prints an error message and returns -1. If the substring is found, it returns the index of the first occurrence; otherwise, it returns -1.
