Here's the mapping of placeholder variable names to descriptive names along with their types and reasoning:

{
  param_1: string_obj,
  param_2: append_str,
  sVar1: append_len,
  lVar2: new_capacity,
  lVar3: new_buffer
}

Reasoning:
1. param_1 -> string_obj (long*): This parameter is a pointer to a String object, which is evident from the error message "The String object is NULL". Renaming it to string_obj makes it clear that it represents the String object being appended to.

2. param_2 -> append_str (char*): This parameter is a pointer to the string that needs to be appended, as indicated by the error message "The strItem is NULL". Renaming it to append_str clarifies its purpose.

3. sVar1 -> append_len (size_t): This variable stores the length of the append_str, calculated using the _strlen function. Renaming it to append_len makes its purpose explicit.

4. lVar2 -> new_capacity (long): This variable is used to calculate the new capacity required for the String object after appending the new string. It is calculated as param_1[1] (current length) + sVar1 (append_len) + 1 (null terminator). Renaming it to new_capacity clarifies its role.

5. lVar3 -> new_buffer (long): This variable holds the result of the memory allocation for the new buffer using _memory_pool_allocate. If the allocation is successful, the String object's buffer is updated to this new buffer. Renaming it to new_buffer indicates its purpose.

The function _string_append appends the string append_str to the String object string_obj. It first checks if the String object and the append_str are not NULL. If the new capacity required exceeds the current capacity, it allocates a new buffer using _memory_pool_allocate, copies the existing contents to the new buffer, and updates the String object's buffer pointer and capacity. Finally, it appends the append_str to the String object's buffer and updates the length.
