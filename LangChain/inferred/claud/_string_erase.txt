Here's the mapping of placeholder variable names to descriptive names, along with the reasoning behind each name:

{
  param_1: string_ptr,
  param_2: erase_start_pos,
  param_3: erase_length,
  local_20: actual_erase_length,
}

Reasoning:
1. param_1 -> string_ptr:
   - The variable is a pointer to a long, which likely represents a pointer to a string object.
   - It is used to access the string data and length, indicating it is a pointer to the string.

2. param_2 -> erase_start_pos:
   - This parameter represents the starting position from where the characters should be erased.
   - It is compared with the string length to check if it is within bounds.

3. param_3 -> erase_length:
   - This parameter specifies the number of characters to be erased from the string.
   - It is used to calculate the actual erase length based on the available characters.

4. local_20 -> actual_erase_length:
   - This local variable is initialized with the value of param_3 (erase_length).
   - It is then adjusted if the requested erase length exceeds the available characters from the starting position to the end of the string.
   - It represents the actual number of characters that will be erased, considering the string bounds.

The function _string_erase seems to be responsible for erasing a specified number of characters from a string starting at a given position. It performs the following steps:

1. It checks if the string pointer (string_ptr) is NULL. If so, it prints an error message.

2. It verifies if the starting position (erase_start_pos) is within the bounds of the string length. If not, it prints an error message.

3. It calculates the actual erase length (actual_erase_length) by considering the requested erase length (erase_length) and the available characters from the starting position to the end of the string.

4. It uses ___memmove_chk to shift the remaining characters after the erased portion to the left, effectively overwriting the erased characters.

5. It updates the string length by subtracting the actual erase length (actual_erase_length) from the current length.

The function modifies the string in-place by erasing the specified characters and adjusting the string length accordingly.
