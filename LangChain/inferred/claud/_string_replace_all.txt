Here's the mapping of placeholder variable names to descriptive names and types, along with the reasoning behind each name:

{
  param_1: string_ptr (pointer to the string to be modified),
  param_2: search_str (the substring to be replaced),
  param_3: replace_str (the string to replace the substring with),
  puVar1: new_string_ptr (pointer to the newly created string),
  pcVar2: found_ptr (pointer to the found occurrence of the substring),
  sVar3: search_len (length of the search substring),
  local_30: current_ptr (pointer to the current position in the string)
}

Reasoning:
- param_1: It is a pointer to the string that will be modified by replacing substrings, so string_ptr is a descriptive name.
- param_2: It represents the substring to be searched for and replaced, so search_str is an appropriate name.
- param_3: It represents the string that will replace the occurrences of the search substring, so replace_str is a fitting name.
- puVar1: It is a pointer to a newly created string that will store the modified string, so new_string_ptr describes its purpose.
- pcVar2: It is a pointer to the found occurrence of the search substring within the string, so found_ptr is a suitable name.
- sVar3: It stores the length of the search substring, so search_len is a descriptive name.
- local_30: It is a pointer that keeps track of the current position in the string during the replacement process, so current_ptr is an appropriate name.

The function _string_replace_all takes a pointer to a string (string_ptr), a search substring (search_str), and a replacement string (replace_str). It replaces all occurrences of the search substring in the string with the replacement string.

The function first checks for null pointers and invalid input. If the input is valid, it creates a new string (new_string_ptr) to store the modified string. It then iterates through the string, finding each occurrence of the search substring using _strstr. For each occurrence, it appends the substring before the occurrence to the new string, appends the replacement string, and moves the current position (current_ptr) to the next character after the occurrence. After the loop, it appends the remaining substring to the new string.

Finally, it assigns the modified string back to the original string pointer using _string_assign, deallocates the new string, and returns.
