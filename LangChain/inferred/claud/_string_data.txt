Here's the mapping of placeholder names to descriptive names and types, along with the reasoning:

{
  param_1: string_ptr,
  local_10: data_ptr,
}

Reasoning:
1. `param_1`:
   - It is a pointer to a `long` value, which likely represents a pointer to a string object.
   - The function name `_string_data` suggests that it operates on string data.
   - Therefore, `param_1` can be named `string_ptr` to indicate that it is a pointer to a string.

2. `local_10`:
   - It is a local variable of type `long`.
   - The variable is assigned the value of `*param_1` if `param_1` is not null and `*param_1` is not zero.
   - It is then returned as the result of the function.
   - Based on the context, `local_10` likely represents a pointer to the actual string data.
   - Hence, `local_10` can be named `data_ptr` to indicate that it holds the pointer to the string data.

The function `_string_data` seems to be a helper function that retrieves the pointer to the actual string data from a string object pointer. It performs null and zero checks on the input pointer to ensure it is valid. If the input is invalid, it prints an error message to `stderr` and returns 0. Otherwise, it returns the pointer to the string data.
