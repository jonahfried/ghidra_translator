Here's the mapping of placeholder variable names to descriptive names along with the reasoning:

{
  param_1: integer,
  sVar1: string_length,
  pvVar2: string_ptr,
  local_1c: string_buffer,
  local_10: stack_guard
}

Reasoning:
1. param_1: This is an input parameter to the function. Based on the usage in the ___sprintf_chk function call, it appears to be an integer value that is being converted to a string. Hence, integer is an appropriate name.

2. sVar1: This variable is assigned the result of _strlen(local_1c), which suggests it represents the length of the string stored in local_1c. Therefore, string_length is a suitable name.

3. pvVar2: This variable is assigned the result of _malloc(sVar1 + 1), indicating it is a pointer to dynamically allocated memory. The allocated memory is used to store a string, so string_ptr is a fitting name.

4. local_1c: This is a local character array of size 12. It is used as a buffer to store the string representation of the integer param_1 using ___sprintf_chk. Therefore, string_buffer is an appropriate name.

5. local_10: This variable is assigned the value of *(long *)PTR____stack_chk_guard_10000a030, which suggests it is related to stack protection or stack canary. The name stack_guard reflects its purpose.

The function _string_from_int_cstr seems to convert an integer to a C-style string. It does the following:
1. Converts the integer param_1 to a string using ___sprintf_chk and stores it in the local_1c buffer.
2. Calculates the length of the resulting string using _strlen.
3. Allocates memory dynamically using _malloc to store the string.
4. Copies the string from local_1c to the dynamically allocated memory using ___strcpy_chk.
5. Performs a stack guard check to detect stack corruption.
6. Returns the pointer to the dynamically allocated string.
