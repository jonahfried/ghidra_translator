Here's the mapping of placeholder variable names to descriptive names along with their types and reasoning:

{
  param_1: string_ptr,
  param_2: new_pool_size,
  lVar1: pool_ptr,
  local_9: return_value,
}

Reasoning:
1. param_1: string_ptr (long *)
   - It is a pointer to a long array that represents a string object.
   - The function name suggests it is related to setting the pool size of a string.
   - It is checked for NULL and used to access string data.

2. param_2: new_pool_size (long)
   - It represents the new size of the memory pool to be created.
   - The function name and error messages indicate it is the new pool size.
   - It is used as an argument to create a new memory pool.

3. lVar1: pool_ptr (long)
   - It is assigned the result of creating a new memory pool.
   - It is used to store the pointer to the newly created memory pool.
   - It is also used to allocate memory for string data in the new pool.

4. local_9: return_value (undefined)
   - It is the variable used to store the return value of the function.
   - It is set to 0 in case of errors and 1 if the operation is successful.
   - The type is undefined because the function return type is not explicitly specified.

The function _string_set_pool_size seems to set the memory pool size for a string object. It takes a pointer to a string object (string_ptr) and the new pool size (new_pool_size) as parameters. It checks for invalid inputs, destroys the existing pool if necessary, creates a new memory pool of the specified size, and allocates memory for the string data in the new pool. The function returns a value (return_value) indicating the success or failure of the operation.
