Here's the mapping of placeholder variable names to descriptive names, along with the reasoning:

{
  param_1: str1_ptr,
  param_2: str2_ptr,
  local_c: compare_result
}

Reasoning:
1. param_1 and param_2:
   - These are function parameters that are pointers to pointers of char (char **).
   - In the context of a string comparison function, these likely represent pointers to the two strings being compared.
   - I named them str1_ptr and str2_ptr to indicate that they are pointers to the first and second strings, respectively.

2. local_c:
   - This is a local variable used to store the result of the string comparison.
   - It is assigned different values based on the comparison outcome.
   - I named it compare_result to clearly convey its purpose of holding the result of the string comparison.

The function _string_compare seems to compare two strings and return an integer value indicating the comparison result. Here's how it works:

1. It first checks if either param_1 or param_2 is NULL (0x0).
   - If both are NULL, it sets compare_result to 0, indicating that the strings are equal.
   - If only one is NULL, it prints an error message using _fprintf and sets compare_result to 1 or -1 depending on which string is NULL.

2. If both param_1 and param_2 are non-NULL, it dereferences them to get the actual string pointers and passes them to the _strcmp function to perform the string comparison.
   - The result of _strcmp is assigned to compare_result.

3. Finally, the function returns compare_result, which holds the result of the string comparison.

The function handles cases where one or both string pointers are NULL and returns an appropriate value based on the comparison outcome.
