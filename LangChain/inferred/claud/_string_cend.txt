Here's the mapping of placeholder variable names to descriptive names along with their types and reasoning:

{
  param_1: string_ptr,
  local_10: end_ptr,
}

Reasoning:
1. param_1 -> string_ptr (long*):
   - The parameter is a pointer to a long, which seems to be a pointer to a string structure.
   - It is used to access the string data and perform operations on it.
   - Renaming it to "string_ptr" clarifies that it is a pointer to a string.

2. local_10 -> end_ptr (long):
   - This local variable is used to store the result of the function, which is the end pointer of the string.
   - It is calculated by adding the value at *param_1 (likely the string length) to the address stored in param_1[1] (likely the string data pointer).
   - Renaming it to "end_ptr" indicates that it represents the end pointer of the string.

The function seems to be named "_string_cend", which suggests it returns the end pointer of a string. It takes a pointer to a string structure as input.

The function first checks if the input string pointer is null or if the first element of the string structure is 0 (which could indicate an uninitialized or empty string). If either condition is true, it prints an error message to stderr and sets the end pointer (local_10) to 0.

If the input string is valid, it calculates the end pointer by adding the value at *param_1 (likely the string length) to the address stored in param_1[1] (likely the string data pointer). This suggests that the string structure might have a layout similar to [length, data_pointer].

Finally, the function returns the calculated end pointer (local_10).
