Here's the mapping of placeholder variable names to descriptive names along with the reasoning:

{
  param_1: string_obj,
  param_2: substring,
  iVar1: cmp_result,
  pcVar2: substring_length,
  local_9: starts_with_substring
}

Reasoning:
- param_1: This is a pointer to a char pointer, likely representing a String object. Hence, string_obj is a suitable name.
- param_2: This is a char pointer passed as the second parameter, and based on the context, it represents the substring to check against. Therefore, substring is an appropriate name.
- iVar1: This variable stores the result of the strncmp function, which compares two strings. So, cmp_result (comparison result) is a fitting name.
- pcVar2: This variable is assigned the result of strlen(param_2), which calculates the length of the substring. Thus, substring_length is a descriptive name.
- local_9: This is a boolean variable that holds the final result of whether the string starts with the given substring. starts_with_substring clearly conveys its purpose.

The function itself checks if a given string (string_obj) starts with a specified substring. It performs null checks on the string object and the substring. If the checks pass, it compares the length of the substring with the length stored in string_obj[1]. If the substring is longer, it returns false. Otherwise, it uses strncmp to compare the first substring_length characters of the string with the substring. If they match, it returns true, indicating that the string starts with the substring.
