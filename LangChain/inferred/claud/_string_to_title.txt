Here's the mapping of placeholder variable names to descriptive names along with their types and reasoning:

{
  param_1: string_ptr (long *),
  bVar1: is_new_word (bool),
  iVar2: char_type (int),
  local_20: char_index (ulong)
}

Reasoning:
1. param_1: This is a pointer to a String object, so string_ptr is a descriptive name. The type is long * based on the function signature.

2. bVar1: This variable is used as a flag to indicate whether the current character is the start of a new word. is_new_word is a descriptive name for this purpose. The type is bool based on the variable declaration.

3. iVar2: This variable is used to store the result of character type checks (_isalpha) and case conversion functions (_toupper, _tolower). char_type is a descriptive name for this purpose. The type is int based on the return type of the character type check and case conversion functions.

4. local_20: This variable is used as an index to iterate over the characters in the string. char_index is a descriptive name for this purpose. The type is ulong based on the variable declaration and its usage in the for loop condition.

The function _string_to_title seems to convert a string to title case, where the first character of each word is capitalized, and the remaining characters are lowercase. It iterates over each character in the string, checks if it's the start of a new word, and applies the appropriate case conversion.
