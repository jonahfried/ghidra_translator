Here's the mapping of placeholder names to inferred names and types, along with the reasoning:

{
  param_1: str1,
  param_2: str2,
}

Reasoning:
- `param_1` and `param_2` are inferred to be strings because they are being passed to a function named `_string_compare`, which suggests that the function compares two strings.
- The names `str1` and `str2` are chosen to represent the two input strings being compared. The names are concise and descriptive, indicating that they are strings and distinguishing between the first and second string.

The function `_string_is_equal` takes two strings as input (`str1` and `str2`) and returns a boolean value indicating whether the two strings are equal. It does this by calling the `_string_compare` function with the two input strings and checking if the result is equal to 0.

In many string comparison functions, a return value of 0 indicates that the strings are equal, while a non-zero value indicates that the strings are not equal or have a specific lexicographical order. Therefore, the `_string_is_equal` function returns `true` if the strings are equal (i.e., `_string_compare` returns 0) and `false` otherwise.

The inferred types for `str1` and `str2` are not explicitly mentioned in the code snippet, but they are likely to be C-style strings (null-terminated character arrays) or pointers to character arrays, as these are common representations of strings in C-based languages.
