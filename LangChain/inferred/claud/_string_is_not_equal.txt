Here's the mapping of placeholder names to inferred names and types, along with the reasoning:

{
  param_1: str1,
  param_2: str2,
}

Reasoning:
- `param_1` and `param_2` are inferred to be strings because they are being passed to a function named `_string_compare`, which suggests that the function compares two strings.
- The names `str1` and `str2` are chosen to indicate that they are the first and second string parameters being compared.
- The `undefined8` type is likely a placeholder for a pointer or reference to a string, as strings are typically passed by reference in C-style functions.

The function `_string_is_not_equal` takes two string parameters, compares them using the `_string_compare` function, and returns a boolean value indicating whether the strings are not equal (i.e., the result of the comparison is non-zero).

Here's the updated code with the inferred names and types:

```c
bool _string_is_not_equal(const char* str1, const char* str2)
{
  int compare_result;
  
  compare_result = _string_compare(str1, str2);
  return compare_result != 0;
}
```

Additional notes:
- The `const char*` type is used to represent a pointer to a null-terminated string in C.
- The variable `iVar1` is renamed to `compare_result` to better describe its purpose of storing the result of the string comparison.
