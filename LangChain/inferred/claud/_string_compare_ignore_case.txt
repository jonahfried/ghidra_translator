Here's the mapping of placeholder variable names to descriptive names along with the reasoning:

{
  param_1: str1_ptr,
  param_2: str2_ptr,
  local_c: compare_result
}

Reasoning:
1. param_1 and param_2:
   - These parameters are pointers to pointers of char (char **), indicating they are likely pointers to strings.
   - The function name suggests that these parameters are the strings being compared.
   - Therefore, descriptive names like str1_ptr and str2_ptr (short for "string 1 pointer" and "string 2 pointer") would be appropriate.

2. local_c:
   - This local variable is used to store the result of the string comparison.
   - It is assigned values like 0, 1, or -1 based on the comparison outcome.
   - A descriptive name like compare_result clearly indicates the purpose of this variable.

The function seems to compare two strings in a case-insensitive manner. Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

1. It first checks if either of the string pointers (param_1 or param_2) is NULL (0x0).
   - If both pointers are NULL, it sets compare_result to 0, indicating equality.
   - If only one pointer is NULL, it sets compare_result to -1 if param_1 is NULL, or 1 if param_2 is NULL.

2. If both string pointers are not NULL, it proceeds to check if either of the strings (*param_1 or *param_2) is an empty string (NULL terminator at the first character).
   - If both strings are empty, it sets compare_result to 0, indicating equality.
   - If only one string is empty, it sets compare_result to -1 if *param_1 is empty, or 1 if *param_2 is empty.

3. If both string pointers and strings are not NULL or empty, it calls the _strcasecmp function to perform a case-insensitive comparison of the strings.
   - The _strcasecmp function likely returns 0 if the strings are equal, a negative value if *param_1 is less than *param_2, or a positive value if *param_1 is greater than *param_2.
   - The result of _strcasecmp is stored in compare_result.

4. Finally, the function returns compare_result, which holds the result of the string comparison.

The function handles various edge cases, such as NULL pointers and empty strings, before performing the actual case-insensitive comparison using _strcasecmp.
