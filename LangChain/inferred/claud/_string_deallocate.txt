Here's the mapping of placeholder variable names to descriptive names along with the reasoning:

{
  param_1: string_ptr,
}

Reasoning:
- param_1: This parameter is a pointer to the string object being deallocated. It's common to name a string pointer as "string_ptr" or similar to indicate that it points to a string. The function name "_string_deallocate" also suggests that the parameter represents a string.

Putting it all together, here's the code with the inferred variable name and type:

```c
void _string_deallocate(void *string_ptr)
{
  if (string_ptr == (void *)0x0) {
    _fprintf(*(FILE **)PTR____stderrp_10000a038,
             "Warning: Attempt to deallocate a NULL String object in string_deallocate.\n");
  }
  else {
    if (*(long *)((long)string_ptr + 0x18) != 0) {
      _memory_pool_destroy(*(undefined8 *)((long)string_ptr + 0x18));
      *(undefined8 *)((long)string_ptr + 0x18) = 0;
    }
    _free(string_ptr);
    if ((_memoryPoolCreated & 1) != 0) {
      _destroy_global_memory_pool();
    }
  }
  return;
}
```

The reasoning behind the inferred name is based on the context provided by the function name and the usage of the parameter within the function. The function is clearly dealing with deallocating a string object, so naming the parameter "string_ptr" accurately represents its purpose.
