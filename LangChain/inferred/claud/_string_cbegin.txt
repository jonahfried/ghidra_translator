Here's the mapping of placeholder names to descriptive names along with their types and reasoning:

{
  param_1: string_ptr,
  local_10: char_ptr,
}

Reasoning:
1. param_1:
   - It is a pointer to a long value, which likely represents a pointer to a String object.
   - In the context of a function named "_string_cbegin", it makes sense for the parameter to be a pointer to the input string.
   - Therefore, a descriptive name for param_1 could be "string_ptr" to indicate that it is a pointer to the input string.

2. local_10:
   - This variable is assigned the value of *param_1 if param_1 is not null and *param_1 is not zero.
   - In the context of a function named "_string_cbegin", which likely stands for "string begin", it suggests that local_10 is meant to store the pointer to the beginning of the string.
   - The value of *param_1 is likely the address of the first character of the string.
   - Therefore, a descriptive name for local_10 could be "char_ptr" to indicate that it is a pointer to the first character of the string.

The function seems to be a helper function that returns a pointer to the beginning of a string. It performs error checking to ensure that the input string pointer is not null and the string is not empty. If the input is invalid, it prints an error message to stderr and returns 0. Otherwise, it returns the pointer to the first character of the string.
