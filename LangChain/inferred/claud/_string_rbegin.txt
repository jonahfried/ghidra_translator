Here's the mapping of placeholder variable names to descriptive names along with the reasoning:

{
  param_1: string_ptr,
  local_10: last_char_ptr,
}

Reasoning:
1. param_1: This parameter is a pointer to a long value, which likely represents a string. In the context of the function name "_string_rbegin", it makes sense to name this parameter "string_ptr" to indicate that it is a pointer to the string.

2. local_10: This local variable is assigned the value of the last character's pointer in the string. It is calculated by adding the base address of the string (*param_1) with the length of the string (param_1[1]) and subtracting 1 to point to the last character. Therefore, "last_char_ptr" is a descriptive name for this variable.

The function seems to be checking for invalid or empty strings. If the string pointer is null, the string is uninitialized (first character is null), or the length is zero, it prints an error message to stderr and sets the return value (last_char_ptr) to 0. Otherwise, it calculates the pointer to the last character of the string and assigns it to last_char_ptr.

The function name "_string_rbegin" suggests that it returns a pointer to the last character of the string, which is consistent with the behavior observed in the code.
