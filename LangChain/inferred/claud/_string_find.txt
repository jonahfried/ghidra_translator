Here's the mapping of placeholder variable names to descriptive names along with their types and reasoning:

{
  param_1: string_obj,
  param_2: search_buffer,
  param_3: start_position,
  pcVar1: found_ptr,
  local_c: result_index
}

Reasoning:
1. `param_1` is renamed to `string_obj` because it seems to be a pointer to a String object. The function checks if `param_1` is NULL or if its data pointer (`*param_1`) is NULL, indicating that it represents a String object.

2. `param_2` is renamed to `search_buffer` because it is used as the search buffer in the `strstr` function call. It represents the substring to be searched within the String object.

3. `param_3` is renamed to `start_position` because it is compared with `param_1[1]`, which likely represents the length of the String object. This suggests that `param_3` is the starting position from where the search should begin within the String object.

4. `pcVar1` is renamed to `found_ptr` because it stores the result of the `strstr` function call, which returns a pointer to the first occurrence of the search buffer within the String object. If the search buffer is not found, `found_ptr` will be NULL.

5. `local_c` is renamed to `result_index` because it stores the final result of the function. It is assigned the index of the found substring within the String object by subtracting the String object's data pointer (`*param_1`) from the `found_ptr`. If the search buffer is not found or an error occurs, `result_index` is set to -1.

The function seems to be implementing a find operation on a String object. It searches for a given substring (`search_buffer`) within the String object starting from a specified position (`start_position`). If the substring is found, it returns the index of the first occurrence. If the substring is not found or an error occurs (e.g., NULL pointers or out-of-bounds position), it returns -1.
