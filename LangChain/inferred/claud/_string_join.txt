Here's the mapping of placeholder variable names to descriptive names along with the reasoning:

{
  param_1: string_array,
  param_2: string_count,
  param_3: delimiter,
  local_34: i,
  local_10: result_string
}

Reasoning:
1. param_1 -> string_array: It seems to be an array of strings based on the usage `**(undefined8 **)(param_1 + (long)local_34 * 8)` which suggests accessing elements of an array using an index.

2. param_2 -> string_count: It appears to be the count or number of strings in the array. It is used in the loop condition `local_34 < param_2` and compared with 1 for validation.

3. param_3 -> delimiter: It is used as a separator when appending strings in the loop, indicating it is a delimiter string.

4. local_34 -> i: It is a loop variable used for iteration, typically named `i` by convention.

5. local_10 -> result_string: It seems to be the resulting string that is created and appended to in the loop. It is returned at the end of the function.

The function `_string_join` appears to take an array of strings (`string_array`), the count of strings (`string_count`), and a delimiter string (`delimiter`). It joins the strings in the array using the delimiter and returns the resulting concatenated string (`result_string`).

The function performs error checking for null string array, invalid count, and null delimiter. It also handles memory allocation failure for the result string.

The loop iterates over the strings in the array, appends each string to the `result_string`, and appends the delimiter if it's not the last string in the array.

Finally, the `result_string` is returned as the joined string.
