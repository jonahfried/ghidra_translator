Here's the mapping of placeholder variable names to descriptive names along with their types and reasoning:

{
  param_1: string_array,
  param_2: substring,
  sVar1: substring_length,
  local_30: current_position,
  local_28: count,
  local_10: return_value,
}

Reasoning:
1. param_1 -> string_array (char **): It is a pointer to a pointer of characters, suggesting it is an array of strings.
2. param_2 -> substring (char *): It is a pointer to a character, indicating it is a string that represents the substring to be counted.
3. sVar1 -> substring_length (size_t): It is assigned the result of _strlen(param_2), which calculates the length of the substring.
4. local_30 -> current_position (char *): It is used to keep track of the current position in the string while searching for occurrences of the substring.
5. local_28 -> count (long): It is used as a counter variable to keep track of the number of occurrences of the substring found in the string.
6. local_10 -> return_value (long): It is the variable that holds the final count of substring occurrences and is returned by the function.

The function _string_count appears to count the number of occurrences of a substring (param_2) within a string (param_1). It first performs some error checks, such as checking for null pointers. If the input is valid, it iterates through the string using _strstr to find occurrences of the substring. Each time the substring is found, the count is incremented, and the current position is updated by moving forward by the length of the substring. Finally, the count of substring occurrences is returned.
