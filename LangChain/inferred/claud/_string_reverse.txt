Here's the mapping of placeholder variable names to descriptive names along with their types and reasoning:

{
  param_1: string_obj_ptr (long*),
  pvVar1: reversed_str_ptr (void*),
  uVar2: original_str_ptr (undefined8),
  local_20: rev_str_index (int),
  local_1c: original_str_index (int)
}

Reasoning:
1. param_1: This is a pointer to a string object, likely of type 'long*'. Renaming it to 'string_obj_ptr' makes it clear that it's a pointer to a string object.

2. pvVar1: This variable is allocated memory to store the reversed string. Renaming it to 'reversed_str_ptr' indicates that it's a pointer to the reversed string.

3. uVar2: This variable is assigned the result of '_string_c_str(param_1)', which likely returns a pointer to the original string. Renaming it to 'original_str_ptr' clarifies that it holds a pointer to the original string.

4. local_20: This variable is used as an index to iterate over the reversed string while copying characters from the original string. Renaming it to 'rev_str_index' makes its purpose clear.

5. local_1c: This variable is used as an index to iterate over the original string in reverse order while copying characters to the reversed string. Renaming it to 'original_str_index' indicates its role in the reversal process.

The function '_string_reverse' takes a pointer to a string object ('string_obj_ptr') and reverses the string in-place. It first checks if the string object or its data is NULL. If not, it allocates memory for the reversed string ('reversed_str_ptr'), copies the characters from the original string to the reversed string in reverse order using the indices 'original_str_index' and 'rev_str_index', and then replaces the original string with the reversed string using '_string_replace'. Finally, it frees the memory allocated for the reversed string.
