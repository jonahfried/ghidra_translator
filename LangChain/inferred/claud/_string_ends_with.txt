Here's the mapping of placeholder variable names to descriptive names along with their types and reasoning:

{
  param_1: string_obj,
  param_2: substring,
  iVar1: cmp_result,
  sVar2: substring_length,
  local_9: ends_with_substring
}

Reasoning:
1. param_1 -> string_obj (type: long*): 
   - It seems to be a pointer to a String object based on the error messages.
   - The name "string_obj" clearly indicates that it represents a String object.

2. param_2 -> substring (type: char*):
   - It is compared with the end of the string, suggesting it is a substring.
   - The name "substring" directly conveys its purpose.

3. iVar1 -> cmp_result (type: int):
   - It stores the result of the strncmp function, which compares two strings.
   - The name "cmp_result" indicates that it holds the result of a comparison.

4. sVar2 -> substring_length (type: size_t):
   - It stores the length of param_2 (substring) using the strlen function.
   - The name "substring_length" clearly describes what it represents.

5. local_9 -> ends_with_substring (type: bool):
   - It is the return value of the function, indicating whether the string ends with the substring.
   - The name "ends_with_substring" explicitly conveys the purpose of the variable.

The function "_string_ends_with" checks if a given string (param_1) ends with a specific substring (param_2). It performs the following steps:

1. It checks if the string object (param_1) is NULL or if its data string is NULL. If either is true, it prints an error message and returns false.

2. It checks if the substring (param_2) is NULL. If true, it prints an error message and returns false.

3. It calculates the length of the substring using strlen and stores it in substring_length (sVar2).

4. It compares the substring_length with the length of the string object. If the substring is longer than the string, it returns false.

5. It compares the substring with the end of the string using strncmp. The comparison starts from the position (string_length - substring_length) in the string. If the comparison result (cmp_result) is 0, indicating a match, it sets ends_with_substring (local_9) to true; otherwise, it sets it to false.

6. Finally, it returns the value of ends_with_substring, indicating whether the string ends with the given substring.
