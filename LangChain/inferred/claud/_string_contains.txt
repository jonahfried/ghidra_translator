Here's the mapping of placeholder variable names to descriptive names, along with the reasoning:

{
  param_1: string_ptr,
  param_2: substring,
  pcVar1: substring_pos,
  local_9: contains_substring
}

Reasoning:
1. param_1 -> string_ptr:
   - It is a pointer to a pointer to a char, which suggests it is a pointer to a string.
   - Renaming it to string_ptr makes it clear that it represents a pointer to the string being searched.

2. param_2 -> substring:
   - It is a pointer to a char, indicating it is a string.
   - Based on the context, it represents the substring being searched for within the main string.
   - Renaming it to substring clearly conveys its purpose.

3. pcVar1 -> substring_pos:
   - It is assigned the result of the _strstr function, which returns a pointer to the first occurrence of the substring in the main string.
   - Renaming it to substring_pos suggests that it represents the position of the substring within the main string.

4. local_9 -> contains_substring:
   - It is a boolean variable that stores the result of the substring search.
   - It is set to true if the substring is found (pcVar1 is not NULL) and false otherwise.
   - Renaming it to contains_substring clearly indicates its purpose of representing whether the main string contains the substring.

The function checks if either the string pointer (param_1) or the substring (param_2) is NULL. If either is NULL, it prints an error message to stderr and returns false. If both are valid, it uses the _strstr function to search for the substring within the main string. The result is stored in substring_pos (pcVar1). If substring_pos is not NULL, it means the substring was found, and contains_substring (local_9) is set to true. Otherwise, contains_substring remains false. Finally, the function returns the value of contains_substring.
