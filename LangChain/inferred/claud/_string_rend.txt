Here's the mapping of placeholder variable names to descriptive names and types, along with the reasoning behind each choice:

{
  param_1: string_ptr,
  local_10: last_char_index,
}

Reasoning:
1. param_1 -> string_ptr:
   - The parameter is a pointer to a long value, which is likely a pointer to a string or character array.
   - It is used to access the first element of the string (*param_1) to check if it is null-terminated.
   - Therefore, renaming it to string_ptr clearly indicates that it is a pointer to a string.

2. local_10 -> last_char_index:
   - This variable is used to store the result of the function, which is the index of the last character in the string.
   - It is calculated by subtracting 1 from the value pointed to by param_1 (*param_1 + -1), which represents the length of the string.
   - Renaming it to last_char_index makes it clear that it holds the index of the last character in the string.

Additional notes:
- The function name _string_rend suggests that it is related to finding the end or last character of a string.
- The function checks if the input string pointer is null (param_1 == (long *)0x0) or if the string is empty (*param_1 == 0) to handle invalid or uninitialized strings.
- If the input is invalid, an error message is printed using _fprintf to the standard error stream (*(FILE **)PTR____stderrp_10000a038).
- If the input is valid, the function calculates the index of the last character by subtracting 1 from the length of the string.

The function appears to be a helper function to find the index of the last character in a string, handling potential errors and edge cases.
