Here's the mapping of placeholder variable names to more descriptive names, along with the reasoning behind each:

{
  param_1: string_obj,
  param_2: insert_pos,
  param_3: insert_str,
  sVar1: insert_str_len,
  lVar2: new_length,
  lVar3: new_buffer
}

Reasoning:
1. param_1: This parameter seems to be a pointer to a string object, so string_obj is a more descriptive name.
2. param_2: This parameter represents the position where the string will be inserted, so insert_pos is a suitable name.
3. param_3: This parameter is the string that will be inserted, so insert_str is an appropriate name.
4. sVar1: This variable stores the length of the string to be inserted, so insert_str_len is a descriptive name.
5. lVar2: This variable calculates the new length of the string after the insertion, so new_length is a fitting name.
6. lVar3: This variable is used to allocate a new buffer when the current buffer is not large enough to accommodate the inserted string, so new_buffer is a suitable name.

The function seems to be performing the following steps:
1. It checks if the string object (string_obj) is NULL, and if so, it prints an error message.
2. It checks if the string to be inserted (insert_str) is NULL, and if so, it prints an error message.
3. It checks if the insertion position (insert_pos) is out of bounds, and if so, it prints an error message.
4. If all the checks pass, it calculates the length of the string to be inserted (insert_str_len) using strlen.
5. It calculates the new length (new_length) of the string after the insertion by adding the current length and the length of the inserted string.
6. If the current buffer is not large enough to accommodate the new length, it allocates a new buffer (new_buffer) using memory_pool_allocate.
   - If the allocation fails, it prints an error message and returns.
   - If the allocation succeeds, it copies the existing string data before and after the insertion position to the new buffer.
7. If the current buffer is large enough, it moves the existing string data after the insertion position to make room for the inserted string using memmove.
8. It copies the inserted string (insert_str) to the appropriate position in the string object using memcpy.
9. Finally, it updates the length of the string object to the new length (new_length).

The function seems to be a string insertion operation that inserts a given string (insert_str) at a specified position (insert_pos) into a string object (string_obj). It handles memory allocation and reallocation if necessary to accommodate the inserted string.
