Here's the mapping of placeholder variable names to descriptive names along with their types and reasoning:

{
  param_1: encoded_str_ptr (long*),
  iVar1: shift_amount (int),
  pvVar2: decoded_str_buffer (void*),
  local_39: current_char (char),
  local_38: decoded_str_length (long),
  local_30: index (ulong),
  local_28: bits_remaining (int),
  local_24: bit_buffer (uint),
  local_10: return_value (undefined8)
}

Reasoning:
1. param_1: It's a pointer to a long, likely a string object containing the base64 encoded string. Hence, encoded_str_ptr.
2. iVar1: It's used to store the shift amount for bit manipulation. Hence, shift_amount.
3. pvVar2: It's a void pointer allocated to store the decoded string. Hence, decoded_str_buffer.
4. local_39: It stores the current character being processed from the encoded string. Hence, current_char.
5. local_38: It keeps track of the length of the decoded string. Hence, decoded_str_length.
6. local_30: It's used as an index to iterate over the encoded string. Hence, index.
7. local_28: It keeps track of the number of bits remaining to form a complete byte during decoding. Hence, bits_remaining.
8. local_24: It's used as a buffer to store the bits during the decoding process. Hence, bit_buffer.
9. local_10: It's the variable that stores the return value of the function, which is likely the decoded string object. Hence, return_value.

The function seems to be decoding a base64 encoded string. It first checks if the input string is valid. If so, it allocates a buffer to store the decoded string. Then it iterates over each character in the encoded string, converts it to a 6-bit value, and packs these 6-bit values into bytes. The decoded bytes are stored in the buffer. Finally, it creates a string object from the decoded buffer and returns it.
