Here's the mapping of placeholder names to inferred names and types, along with the reasoning:

{
  param_1: str1,
  param_2: str2,
}

Reasoning:
- param_1 and param_2 are passed as arguments to the _string_compare function, which suggests that they are likely strings. Therefore, I inferred their types as strings and named them str1 and str2 respectively to indicate that they are the first and second strings being compared.
- The function name _string_is_less_or_equal implies that it checks if one string is less than or equal to another string. The naming of str1 and str2 follows the convention of the function name, where str1 is the first string and str2 is the second string in the comparison.
- The function returns a boolean value based on the result of the _string_compare function. If the result is less than 1 (i.e., if str1 is less than or equal to str2), the function returns true; otherwise, it returns false.

So, the inferred names str1 and str2 clearly convey that they are the two strings being compared in the _string_is_less_or_equal function, and their naming follows the context of the function's purpose.
