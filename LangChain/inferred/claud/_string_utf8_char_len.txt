Here's the mapping of placeholder names to descriptive names along with the reasoning:

{
  param_1: char_code,
  local_10: char_len
}

Reasoning:
1. `param_1`: This parameter represents a character code point. It is used to determine the length of the UTF-8 character based on the binary representation of the character code. Therefore, a descriptive name for this parameter could be `char_code`.

2. `local_10`: This local variable is used to store the length of the UTF-8 character. It is assigned different values based on the conditions checked against the character code. The value represents the number of bytes required to represent the character in UTF-8 encoding. Hence, an appropriate name for this variable could be `char_len`.

The function `_string_utf8_char_len` takes a character code as input and determines the length of the UTF-8 character based on the binary representation of the character code. It checks the leading bits of the character code to determine the number of bytes required to represent the character in UTF-8 encoding.

- If the most significant bit is 0, it means the character is a single-byte ASCII character, and the length is 1.
- If the two most significant bits are 110 (binary), it indicates a two-byte UTF-8 character, and the length is 2.
- If the three most significant bits are 1110 (binary), it represents a three-byte UTF-8 character, and the length is 3.
- If the four most significant bits are 11110 (binary), it denotes a four-byte UTF-8 character, and the length is 4.
- If none of the above conditions are met, it means the character code is invalid, and the length is set to 0.

The function returns the determined character length as an `undefined8` type, which is likely an 8-byte unsigned integer type.
