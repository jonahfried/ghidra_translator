Here's the mapping of placeholder variable names to descriptive names along with the reasoning:

{
  param_1: string_ptr,
  local_20: char_index,
  local_9: is_alpha
}

Reasoning:
1. `param_1`: This parameter is a pointer to a long, which likely represents a string pointer. The function seems to be checking if the characters in the string are alphabetic. Therefore, `string_ptr` is a suitable name.

2. `local_20`: This variable is used as a loop counter to iterate over the characters of the string. It represents the index of the current character being checked. Hence, `char_index` is an appropriate name.

3. `local_9`: This variable is used to store the result of the function. It is set to 0 if the input string pointer is null, and set to 1 if all characters in the string are alphabetic. Therefore, `is_alpha` is a good name to represent the purpose of this variable.

The function `_string_is_alpha` takes a pointer to a string (`string_ptr`) and checks if all characters in the string are alphabetic (either lowercase or uppercase letters). It returns 1 (`is_alpha`) if all characters are alphabetic, and 0 otherwise.

The function first checks if the input string pointer is null. If it is, it sets `is_alpha` to 0 and returns.

If the string pointer is not null, the function iterates over each character of the string using the `char_index` variable. For each character, it checks if it is within the range of lowercase letters ('a' to 'z') or uppercase letters ('A' to 'Z'). If any character is found to be non-alphabetic, the function immediately returns 0.

If all characters in the string are alphabetic, the function sets `is_alpha` to 1 and returns.
