Here's the mapping of placeholder variable names to descriptive names along with their types and reasoning:

{
  param_1: string_ptr (long *),
  param_2: start_index (ulong),
  param_3: end_index (ulong)
}

Reasoning:
1. param_1:
   - Inferred name: string_ptr
   - Type: long *
   - Reasoning: The function name suggests that param_1 is a pointer to a string object. It is dereferenced to access the string data and length, indicating it is a pointer to a long array or struct representing the string.

2. param_2:
   - Inferred name: start_index
   - Type: ulong
   - Reasoning: The function name and the usage of param_2 suggest that it represents the starting index of the range to be removed from the string. It is compared with param_3 to ensure a valid range.

3. param_3:
   - Inferred name: end_index
   - Type: ulong
   - Reasoning: Similar to param_2, the function name and usage of param_3 indicate that it represents the ending index of the range to be removed from the string. It is compared with param_2 and the string length to ensure a valid range.

The function _string_remove_range seems to remove a range of characters from a string object. It first checks if the string pointer is null or if the string is empty, and prints an error message if so. Then, it verifies that the start_index is less than the end_index and that the end_index is within the bounds of the string length. If the range is valid, it uses ___memmove_chk to shift the characters after the removed range to the start_index, effectively removing the characters in the specified range. Finally, it updates the string length by subtracting the number of removed characters.
