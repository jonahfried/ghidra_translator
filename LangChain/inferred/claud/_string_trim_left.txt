Here's the mapping of placeholder variable names to descriptive names along with the reasoning:

{
  param_1: string_obj,
  iVar1: is_space_result,
  bVar2: is_space,
  local_18: left_trim_index,
}

Reasoning:
1. param_1: This is the input parameter to the function, which seems to be a pointer to a string object. Hence, string_obj is a suitable name.

2. iVar1: This variable stores the result of the _isspace function, which checks if a character is a whitespace. Therefore, is_space_result is an appropriate name.

3. bVar2: This boolean variable is used to store the result of the comparison iVar1 != 0, which essentially checks if the character is a whitespace. So, is_space is a fitting name.

4. local_18: This variable is used as an index to iterate through the string from the left side and keep track of the number of whitespace characters encountered. Thus, left_trim_index is a suitable name.

The function _string_trim_left seems to trim the whitespace characters from the left side of the string. It first checks if the input string object is null, and if so, it prints an error message. If the string is not empty (param_1[1] != 0), it iterates through the string from the left side using the left_trim_index. It checks each character using _isspace to determine if it is a whitespace character. If a non-whitespace character is encountered, the loop breaks. Finally, if any whitespace characters were found (left_trim_index != 0), it uses ___memmove_chk to shift the remaining characters to the left, effectively trimming the whitespace from the left side of the string. It updates the length of the string (param_1[1]) and null-terminates the string.
