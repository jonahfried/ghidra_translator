Here's the mapping of placeholder names to inferred names and types, along with the reasoning:

{
  param_1: string1,
  param_2: string2,
}

Reasoning:
- `param_1` and `param_2` are inferred to be of type `string` (or a string-like type) because they are being passed to a function named `_string_compare`, which suggests that the function compares two strings.
- The names `string1` and `string2` are chosen to indicate that they represent the first and second strings being compared, respectively. The names are concise and descriptive of their purpose in the context of the `_string_is_less` function.

The `_string_is_less` function compares two strings using the `_string_compare` function and returns a boolean value indicating whether the first string is considered "less than" the second string based on the comparison result.

- The return type of the function is `bool`, indicating that it returns a boolean value.
- The comparison `iVar1 < 0` suggests that the `_string_compare` function returns a negative value if `string1` is considered "less than" `string2` based on some comparison criteria (e.g., lexicographical order).

So, the `_string_is_less` function is essentially a wrapper around the `_string_compare` function, providing a convenient way to check if one string is "less than" another string based on the comparison result.
