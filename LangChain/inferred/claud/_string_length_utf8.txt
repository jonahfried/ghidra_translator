Here's the mapping of placeholder variable names to descriptive names along with the reasoning:

{
  param_1: str,
  local_20: length,
  local_18: current_char,
  local_10: result
}

Reasoning:
1. `param_1`:
   - Inferred name: `str`
   - Reason: The parameter is a pointer to a character (`char *`), which suggests it represents a string. The name `str` is a common and concise name for a string variable.

2. `local_20`:
   - Inferred name: `length`
   - Reason: This variable is initialized to 0 and is incremented inside the loop whenever a character is not a continuation byte of a UTF-8 sequence. It keeps track of the length of the string in terms of UTF-8 characters. Therefore, `length` is an appropriate name.

3. `local_18`:
   - Inferred name: `current_char`
   - Reason: This variable is used as a pointer to iterate over each character of the string. It starts from `param_1` (the input string) and is incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop. The name `current_char` indicates that it represents the current character being processed.

4. `local_10`:
   - Inferred name: `result`
   - Reason: This variable is used to store the final length of the string. It is assigned the value of `local_20` (length) before the function returns. The name `result` suggests that it holds the final result of the function.

The function `_string_length_utf8` takes a string (`str`) as input and calculates its length in terms of UTF-8 characters. It iterates over each character of the string using `current_char`. If the current character is not a continuation byte of a UTF-8 sequence (i.e., its two most significant bits are not `10`), it increments the `length` variable. Finally, the function assigns the calculated length to the `result` variable and returns it.

If the input string is null, the function prints an error message to `stderr` and returns 0 as the result.
