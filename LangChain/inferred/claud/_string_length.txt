Here's the mapping of placeholder names to inferred names and types, along with the reasoning:

{
  param_1: string_ptr,
  local_10: length
}

Reasoning:
- param_1: This parameter is likely a pointer to a String object, based on the function name "_string_length" and the NULL check performed on param_1. Therefore, I inferred the name "string_ptr" to indicate that it is a pointer to a string.

- local_10: This local variable is assigned the value of *(undefined8 *)(param_1 + 8) when param_1 is not NULL. In many string implementations, the length of the string is often stored as a field within the string object itself. The offset of 8 bytes suggests that the length might be stored at that offset within the String object. Therefore, I inferred the name "length" for local_10, as it likely represents the length of the string.

The function seems to retrieve the length of a given String object. If the String object pointer is NULL, it prints an error message to stderr and returns 0. Otherwise, it retrieves the length value stored at an offset of 8 bytes within the String object and returns that value.
