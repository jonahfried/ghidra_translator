Here's the mapping of placeholder variable names to descriptive names along with their types and reasoning:

{
  param_1: hex_string_ptr (long*),
  uVar1: is_empty (ulong),
  lVar2: char_value (long),
  local_2b: hex_char1 (char),
  local_2a: hex_char2 (char),
  local_29: null_terminator (char),
  local_28: index (ulong),
  local_20: result_string (long),
  local_18: hex_string_ptr_copy (long*),
  local_10: return_value (long)
}

Reasoning:
- param_1: It's a pointer to a string containing hex characters, so hex_string_ptr is a descriptive name.
- uVar1: It stores the result of _string_empty function which checks if the string is empty, so is_empty is an appropriate name.
- lVar2: It stores the converted character value from hex to decimal using strtol, so char_value is a suitable name.
- local_2b and local_2a: They store individual hex characters from the input string, so hex_char1 and hex_char2 are descriptive names.
- local_29: It's always assigned 0, which is the null terminator for strings, so null_terminator is a fitting name.
- local_28: It's used as an index variable in the loop to iterate over the hex string, so index is an appropriate name.
- local_20: It stores the resulting string after converting hex to characters, so result_string is a descriptive name.
- local_18: It's a copy of the input hex_string_ptr used throughout the function, so hex_string_ptr_copy is a suitable name.
- local_10: It stores the value that the function returns, so return_value is an appropriate name.

The types are inferred based on the usage and context of the variables in the code.
