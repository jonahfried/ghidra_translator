Here's the mapping of placeholder variable names to descriptive names along with the reasoning:

{
  param_1: string_ptr,
  iVar1: is_space_result,
  bVar2: is_space,
  local_18: index
}

Reasoning:
- param_1: This is a pointer to a string object, so string_ptr is a good descriptive name.
- iVar1: This variable stores the result of the _isspace function, which checks if a character is a whitespace. So, is_space_result is an appropriate name.
- bVar2: This is a boolean variable that is set based on the result of _isspace. It indicates whether the character is a whitespace or not. Hence, is_space is a suitable name.
- local_18: This variable is used as an index to iterate over the characters of the string from the end. It starts from the length of the string and decrements until a non-whitespace character is found. Therefore, index is a fitting name.

The function _string_trim_right seems to trim the whitespace characters from the right end of the string. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the code:

1. It first checks if the string pointer (param_1) is null. If it is, it prints an error message using _fprintf.

2. If the string pointer is not null and the length of the string (param_1[1]) is not zero, it proceeds to trim the whitespace characters.

3. It initializes the index variable (local_18) with the length of the string.

4. It enters a loop that continues until a non-whitespace character is found from the right end of the string.

5. Inside the loop, it checks if the current index is not zero (to avoid going out of bounds).

6. If the index is not zero, it retrieves the character at the current index (*(byte *)(*param_1 + (local_18 - 1))) and passes it to the _isspace function to check if it is a whitespace character.

7. If the character is a whitespace, it decrements the index and continues the loop. If the character is not a whitespace, it breaks out of the loop.

8. After the loop, it checks if the final index (local_18) is less than the original length of the string (param_1[1]). If it is, it means that whitespace characters were found and trimmed.

9. It sets the character at the final index to null-terminator (0) to mark the new end of the string and updates the length of the string (param_1[1]) to the final index.

10. Finally, the function returns.
